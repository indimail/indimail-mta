LDAP support based on a patch by:
Luc Saillard <luc.saillard@alcove.fr>  Thu, 30 Dec 1999 20:33:08 +0100

Adapted as a generic authlib authentication module - SV 12/31/99.

Configuration File
------------------

     LDAP configuration is placed in the file authldaprc, which is installed,
     by default, as /usr/lib/courier-imap/etc/authldaprc.
     Use --with-authldaprc=pathname to override the location.

     This file must be owned by root and have the permissions set to 0400
     because the LDAP administrator password is stored in this file.

     See the default authldaprc for more information.

     CC both me and Luc Saillard for questions on authldap.

Schema
------

OpenLDAP 2.0 defaults to schema checking on all directories.  The file
authldap.schema contains a definition of a LDAP objects
CourierMailAccount, CourierMailAlias, and CourierDomainAlias.

Only CourierMailAccount is used for mailbox authentication (i.e. IMAP,
webmail).  The other two objects are used by LDAP-based mail routing
in the Courier Mail Server.

Here are some sample LDAP objects that use this schema:

dn: o=example, c=com
ObjectClass: organization
o: example
c: com

dn: mail=xyz123@example.com, o=example, c=com
ObjectClass: CourierMailAccount
mail: xyz123@example.com
mail: xyz123
clearPassword: tux
userPassword: {MD5}WrbkuYvH+3FvwH7Zj+34Ag==
homeDirectory: /home/xyz123
uidNumber: 1001
gidNumber: 1001

dn: mail=mailalias@example.com, o=example, c=com
ObjectClass: CourierMailAlias
mail: mailalias
maildrop: xyz123

dn: virtualdomain=domain.com, o=example, c=com
ObjectClass: CourierDomainAlias
virtualdomain: domain.com
virtualdomainuser: wxyz456
