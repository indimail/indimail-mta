##NAME: MYSQL_CRYPT_PWFIELD:0
#
# Either MYSQL_CRYPT_PWFIELD or MYSQL_CLEAR_PWFIELD must be defined.  Both
# are OK too. crypted passwords go into MYSQL_CRYPT_PWFIELD, cleartext
# passwords go into MYSQL_CLEAR_PWFIELD.  Cleartext passwords allow
# CRAM-MD5 authentication to be implemented.

##NAME: MYSQL_GID_FIELD:0

#

MYSQL_LOGIN_FIELD	id

##NAME: MYSQL_HOME_FIELD:0
#

MYSQL_HOME_FIELD	home

##NAME: MYSQL_NAME_FIELD:0
#
# The user's name (optional)

MYSQL_NAME_FIELD	name

##NAME: MYSQL_MAILDIR_FIELD:0
#
# This is an optional field, and can be used to specify an arbitrary
# location of the maildir for the account, which normally defaults to
# $HOME/Maildir (where $HOME is read from MYSQL_HOME_FIELD).
#
# You still need to provide a MYSQL_HOME_FIELD, even if you uncomment this
# out.
#
# MYSQL_MAILDIR_FIELD	maildir

##NAME: MYSQL_DEFAULTDELIVERY:0
#
# Courier mail server only: optional field specifies custom mail delivery
# instructions for this account (if defined) -- essentially overrides
# DEFAULTDELIVERY from ${sysconfdir}/courierd
#
# MYSQL_DEFAULTDELIVERY defaultdelivery

##NAME: MYSQL_QUOTA_FIELD:0
#
# Define MYSQL_QUOTA_FIELD to be the name of the field that can optionally
# specify a maildir quota.  See README.maildirquota for more information 
#
# MYSQL_QUOTA_FIELD	quota

##NAME: MYSQL_AUXOPTIONS:0
#
# Auxiliary options.  The MYSQL_AUXOPTIONS field should be a char field that
# contains a single string consisting of comma-separated "ATTRIBUTE=NAME"
# pairs.  These names are additional attributes that define various per-account
# "options", as given in INSTALL's description of the "Account OPTIONS"
# setting.
#
# MYSQL_AUXOPTIONS_FIELD	auxoptions
#
# You might want to try something like this, if you'd like to use a bunch
# of individual fields, instead of a single text blob:
#
# MYSQL_AUXOPTIONS_FIELD	CONCAT("disableimap=",disableimap,",disablepop3=",disablepop3,",disablewebmail=",disablewebmail,",sharedgroup=",sharedgroup)
#
# This will let you define fields called "disableimap", etc, with the end result
# being something that the OPTIONS parser understands.


##NAME: MYSQL_WHERE_CLAUSE:0
#
# This is optional, MYSQL_WHERE_CLAUSE can be basically set to an arbitrary
# fixed string that is appended to the WHERE clause of our query
#
# MYSQL_WHERE_CLAUSE	server='mailhost.example.com'

##NAME: MYSQL_SELECT_CLAUSE:0
#
# (EXPERIMENTAL)
# This is optional, MYSQL_SELECT_CLAUSE can be set when you have a database,
# which is structuraly different from proposed. The fixed string will
# be used to do a SELECT operation on database, which should return fields
# in order specified bellow:
#
# username, cryptpw, clearpw, uid, gid, home, maildir, quota, fullname, options
#
# The username field should include the domain (see example below).
#
# Enabling this option causes ignorance of any other field-related
# options, excluding default domain.
#
# There are two variables, which you can use. Substitution will be made
# for them, so you can put entered username (local part) and domain name
# in the right place of your query. These variables are:
#	 	$(local_part), $(domain), $(service)
#
# If a $(domain) is empty (not given by the remote user) the default domain
# name is used in its place.
#
# $(service) will expand out to the service being authenticated: imap, imaps,
# pop3 or pop3s.  Courier mail server only: service will also expand out to
# "courier", when searching for local mail account's location.  In this case,
# if the "maildir" field is not empty it will be used in place of
# DEFAULTDELIVERY.  Courier mail server will also use esmtp when doing
# authenticated ESMTP.
#
# This example is a little bit modified adaptation of vmail-sql
# database scheme:
#
# MYSQL_SELECT_CLAUSE	SELECT CONCAT(popbox.local_part, '@', popbox.domain_name),			\
#			CONCAT('{MD5}', popbox.password_hash),		\
#			popbox.clearpw,					\
#			domain.uid,					\
#			domain.gid,					\
#			CONCAT(domain.path, '/', popbox.mbox_name),	\
#			'',						\
#			domain.quota,					\
#			'',						\
#			CONCAT("disableimap=",disableimap,",disablepop3=",    \
#                              disablepop3,",disablewebmail=",disablewebmail, \
#                              ",sharedgroup=",sharedgroup)             \
#			FROM popbox, domain				\
#			WHERE popbox.local_part = '$(local_part)'	\
#			AND popbox.domain_name = '$(domain)'		\
#			AND popbox.domain_name = domain.domain_name


##NAME: MYSQL_ENUMERATE_CLAUSE:0
#
# {EXPERIMENTAL}
# Optional custom SQL query used to enumerate accounts for authenumerate,
# in order to compile a list of accounts for shared folders.  The query
# should return the following fields: name, uid, gid, homedir, maildir
#
# Example:
# MYSQL_ENUMERATE_CLAUSE	SELECT CONCAT(popbox.local_part, '@', popbox.domain_name),			\
#			domain.uid,					\
#			domain.gid,					\
#			CONCAT(domain.path, '/', popbox.mbox_name),	\
#			''						\
#			FROM popbox, domain				\
#			WHERE popbox.local_part = '$(local_part)'	\
#			AND popbox.domain_name = '$(domain)'		\
#			AND popbox.domain_name = domain.domain_name



##NAME: MYSQL_CHPASS_CLAUSE:0
#
# (EXPERIMENTAL)
# This is optional, MYSQL_CHPASS_CLAUSE can be set when you have a database,
# which is structuraly different from proposed. The fixed string will
# be used to do an UPDATE operation on database. In other words, it is
# used, when changing password.
#
# There are four variables, which you can use. Substitution will be made
# for them, so you can put entered username (local part) and domain name
# in the right place of your query. There variables are:
# 	$(local_part) , $(domain) , $(newpass) , $(newpass_crypt)
#
# If a $(domain) is empty (not given by the remote user) the default domain
# name is used in its place.
# $(newpass) contains plain password
# $(newpass_crypt) contains its crypted form
#
# MYSQL_CHPASS_CLAUSE	UPDATE	popbox					\
#			SET	clearpw='$(newpass)',			\
#				password_hash='$(newpass_crypt)'	\
#			WHERE	local_part='$(local_part)'		\
#			AND	domain_name='$(domain)'
#
