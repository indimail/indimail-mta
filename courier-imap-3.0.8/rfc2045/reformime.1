.SH NAME
reformime \- MIME E-mail reformatting tool
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBreformime\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBreformime\fR is a utility for reformatting
MIME messages.
.PP
Generally, \fBreformime\fR expects to see an
RFC 2045
compliant message on standard input, except in few cases
such as the \fB-m\fR option.
.PP
If no options are given, \fBreformime\fR prints the MIME
structure of the message. The output consists of so-called
"MIME reference tags", one per line.
For example:
.sp
.RS
.PP

.nf
1
1.1
1.2
.fi
.RE
.PP
This shows that the message contains two different MIME sections. The
first line of the MIME structure output will always contain "1", which refers
to the entire message.
In this case it happens to be a multipart/mixed
message. "1.1" refers to the first section of the multipart message, which
happens to be a
text/plain section. "1.2" refers to the second
section of the message, which happens to be an
application/octet-stream section.
.PP
If the message is not a MIME message, or it does not contain any
attachments, \fBreformime\fR prints only "1", that refers
to the entire message itself:
.sp
.RS
.PP

.nf
1
.fi
.RE
.PP
Here's the output from
\fBreformime\fR when the first part of the message was itself a
multipart/alternative section:
.sp
.RS
.PP

.nf
1
1.1
1.1.1
1.1.2
1.2
.fi
.RE
.PP
Arbitrarily complex MIME constructs are possible.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Parse a delivery status notification MIME message
(RFC 1894).
\fBreformime\fR
expects to see on standard input a MIME message that consists of
a delivery status notification, as defined by RFC 1894.
\fBreformime\fR
reads
the message and prints on standard output a list of addresses and their
corresponding delivery status, as specified in the delivery status
notification. Each line printed by
\fBreformime\fR
consists of a delivery
status, a space, and the address.
\fBreformime\fR then terminates with a 0 exit status.
\fBreformime\fR produces no output and terminates with an exit
status of 1 if the standard input does not contain a delivery status
notification.
.TP
\fB-D\fR
Like the \fB-d\fR except that
\fBreformime\fR lists the address
found in the Original-Recipient: header,
if it exists.
.TP
\fB-e\fR
Rxtract the contents of the indicated MIME section, and display it
on standard output.
The \fB-s\fR option is required when
\fB-e\fR is specified. If the
indicated section uses either the base64 or
quoted-printable encoding method,
\fBreformime\fR automatically
decodes it. In this case you're better off redirecting the standard output
into a file.
.TP
\fB-i\fR
Display MIME information for each section. \fBreformime\fR
displays the contents of the
Content-Type: header, any encoding used,
and the character set.
\fBreformime\fR also displays the byte offset in the message
where each section starts and ends (and where the
actual contents of the section start, after skipping all the headers).
.TP
\fB-m\fR
Create a multipart/digest MIME message digest.
.TP
\fB-r\fR
Rewrite message, adding or standardizing
RFC 2045
MIME headers.
.TP
\fB-r7\fR
Like \fB-r\fR but also convert 8bit-encoded
MIME sections to quoted-printable\&.
.TP
\fB-r8\fR
Like \fB-r\fR but also convert
quoted-printable-encoded MIME sections to
8bit\&.
.TP
\fB-s \fIsection\fB\fR
Display MIME information for this section only.
\fIsection\fR is
a MIME specification tag. The \fB-s\fR option is required if
\fB-e\fR is also
specified, and is optional with \fB-i\fR\&.
.TP
\fB-x\fR
Extract the contents of the indicated MIME section to a file.
.TP
\fB-X\fR
Pipe the contents of the indicated MIME section to a program.
.SS "EXTRACTING RFC 2045 MIME SECTION(S) TO FILE(S)"
.PP
The \fB-x\fR and \fB-X\fR options extract a specific
MIME section to a file or to a pipe to an external program.
Use the \fB-s\fR option to identify the MIME section
to extract.  If the \fB-s\fR option is not specified,
every MIME section in the message is extracted, one at a time.
quoted-printable and base64 encoding are
automatically decoded.
.TP
\fB-x\fR
Interactive extraction. \fBreformime\fR prints the MIME
content type of each section.  Answer with 'y' or 'Y' to extract the MIME
section. Specify the filename at the next prompt. \fBreformime\fR
prompts with a default filename.
\fBreformime\fR tries to choose the default
filename based on the MIME headers, if possible. If not, the default
filename will be attachment1.dat (if the -s option is not
specified, the next filename will be attachment2.dat,
and so on).
.TP
\fB-x\fIPREFIX\fB\fR
Automatic extraction. \fBreformime\fR automatically
extracts one or more MIME sections, and saves them to a file.
The filename is formed by taking
\fIPREFIX\fR, and appending the default filename to it.
Note that there's no space between "-x" and "PREFIX". For example:
.sp
.RS
.PP

.nf
reformime -xfiles-
.fi
.RE

This command saves MIME sections as
\fIfiles-attachment1.dat\fR, then
\fIfiles-attachment2.dat\fR, etc.
\fBreformime\fR tries to append the filename specified in the
MIME headers for each section, where possible.
\fBreformime\fR replaces all suspect characters with the
underscore character.
.TP
\fB-X prog arg1 arg2 ...\fR
The \fB-X\fR option must be the last option to
\fBreformime\fR\&. \fBreformime\fR runs an external
program \fBprog\fR, and pipes the contents of the MIME section to
the program. \fBreformime\fR sets the environment variable
\fBCONTENT_TYPE\fR to the MIME content type.  The environment
variable \fBFILENAME\fR gets set to the default filename of
\fBreformime\fR\&'s liking. If the \fB-s\fR option is
not specified, the program runs once
for every MIME section in the message.
The external program, \fBprog\fR must terminate with a zero
exit status in order for \fBreformime\fR to proceed to the
next MIME section in the message.
In any case, if \fBprog\fR terminates with a non-zero exit
status, \fBreformime\fR terminates with the exit status of
20 plus \fBprog\fR\&'s exit status.
.sp
.RS
.B "Note:"
\fBreformime\fR extracts every MIME section in the message
unless the \fB-s\fR option is specified.
This includes even the text/plain MIME
content that usually precedes a binary attachment.
.RE
.SS "ADDING RFC 2045 MIME HEADERS"
.PP
The \fB-r\fR option performs the following actions:
.PP
If there is no Mime-Version:,
Content-Type:, or
Content-Transfer-Encoding: header,
\fBreformime\fR adds one.
.PP
If the Content-Transfer-Encoding: header contains
8bit or raw, but only seven-bit data is
found, \fBreformime\fR changes
the Content-Transfer-Encoding header to
7bit\&.
.PP
\fB-r7\fR does the same thing, but also converts
8bit-encoded content that contains eight-bit characters to
quoted-printable encoding.
.PP
\fB-r8\fR does the same thing, but also converts
quoted-printable-encoded content to
8bit, except in some situations.
.SS "CREATING MULTIPART/DIGEST MIME DIGESTS"
.PP
The \fB-m\fR option creates a MIME digest.
\fBreformime\fR reads a list of filenames on standard input.
Each line read from standard input contains the name of a file that is
presumed to contain an RFC 2822-formatted message.
\fBreformime\fR splices all files into a
\fBmultipart/digest\fR MIME section,
and writes it to standard output.
.SS "TRANSLATING MIME HEADERS"
.PP
The following options do not read a message from standard input.
These options process MIME headers via the command line, and are designed
to be conveniently used by mail-handling scripts.
.TP
\fB-h "\fIheader\fB"\fR
Decode a MIME-encoded "\fIheader\fR" and print the
decoded 8-bit content on standard output.  Example:


.nf
$ reformime -h '=?iso-8859-1?Q?H=F3la!?='
Hóla!
.fi
.TP
\fB-o "\fItext\fB"\fR
MIME-encode "\fItext\fR", and print the results
on standard output.
Use the \fB-c\fR option to specify the character set.
.TP
\fB-O "\fItext\fB"\fR
Like the \fB-o option\fR, except that
\fItext\fR
is a structured header with RFC 2822 addresses.
