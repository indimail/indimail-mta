.SH NAME
maildirkw \- set maildir message keywords
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBmaildirkw\fR [ \fB-c\fR ] [ \fB-l\fR ] [ \fB-a\fR ] [ \fB-r\fR ] \fB\fImaildir\fB\fR \fB\fImessage\fB\fR [ \fB\fIkeyword\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]


\fBmaildirkw\fR [ \fB-c\fR ] \fB-L\fR \fB\fImaildir\fB\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmaildirkw\fR
modifies \fBCourier-IMAP\fR compatible maildir message
keywords.
This command allows an easy way to set or clear custom IMAP keywords
associated with a particular message.
\fImaildir\fR is the pathname to a maildir, or a maildir
folder.
The \fB-L\fR option lists all messages in the maildir, and their
associated keywords.
\fImessage\fR specified which message's keywords
should be set.
One or more \fIkeyword\fRs specifies a list of keywords
to be set for this message.
The specified list of \fIkeyword\fRs replaces any
keywords presently set for the \fImessage\fR,
unless the
\fB-a\fR or the
\fB-r\fR option is specified.
.PP
The
\fB-a\fR option adds the \fIkeyword\fR to
existing keywords that are set for \fImessage\fR\&.
The
\fB-r\fR removes \fIkeyword\fRs from
\fImessage\fR, leaving any remaining keywords set in
place.
.PP
The
\fB-l\fR should be used if \fBCourier-IMAP\fR\&'s
configuration file has the IMAP_USELOCKS option set.
\fB-l\fR
enables a compatible locking mechanism to update the message's keywords.
.PP
\fB-c\fR enables case-sensitive keywords.
IMAP keywords are normally case insensitive.
\fB-c\fR needs to be used if the
SMAP1
protocol extension is used, which uses case sensitive keywords.
