Description: daemontools is a collection of tools for managing UNIX services. 
 svscan scans a directory and starts a supervise process for each
 subdirectory of the scanned directory. It restarts the supervise process if
 it dies.
 .
 supervise monitors a service. It starts the service and restarts the
 service if it dies. Setting up a new service is easy: all supervise
 needs is a directory with a run script that runs the service.
 .
 multilog saves error messages to one or more logs. It optionally
 timestamps each line and, for each log, includes or excludes lines
 matching specified patterns. It automatically rotates logs to limit the
 amount of disk space used. If the disk fills up, it pauses and tries
 again, without losing any data.
