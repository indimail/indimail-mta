.SH NAME
installer \- create directories, create/copy files, named pipes and devices

instcheck \- check installed files for existence, owner, group, permissions

.SH SYNOPSYS
\fB@libexecdir@/installer\fR [-cfum] \fIdest\fR

\fB@libexecdir@/instcheck\fR [-cfm] \fI[package]\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBinstaller\fR program create directories, install files from source
directories, create files with zeros, symbolic links, named pipes and
devices files in directory \fIdest\fR of your choice. \fBinstaller\fR takes
input from descriptor 0. It expects the data on descriptor 0 to be of the
following form.

.EX
\fItype\fR:\fIowner\fR:\fIgroup\fR:\fImode\fR:\fItarget\fR:\fIsource\fR:
.EE

Here \fItype\fR is either of d, l, f, z, p, c as following
.TP 2
d
= directory
.TP
l
= symbolic link
.TP
f
= file
.TP
z
= file with fixed number of zeroes
.TP
p
= named pipe
.TP
c
= device file

.PP
\fIowner\fR is the owner of the \fItarget\fR (user name or numeric user ID),
\fIgroup\fR is the group membership of the \fItarget\fR (group name or numeric
group ID) of the \fItarget\fR, \fImode\fR is the file mode bits of the
\fItarget\fR. \fItarget\fR is a relative or absolute path of the filename
in \fIdest\fR. \fIsource\fR is a relative or absolute path of the source
filename. \fItarget\fR can be a directory, file, symbolic link, fifo or a
device The lines expected by \fBinstaller\fr has to be any of the following
forms given below. Invalid data is silently ignored.

.EX
 Directory
 \fBd\fR:\fIowner\fR:\fIgroup\fR:\fImode\fR:\fItarget_dir\fR::

 Soft link
 \fBl\fR:\fIowner\fR:\fIgroup\fR:\fImode\fR:\fItarget_link\fR::\fIsource\fR:

 File
 \fBf\fR:\fIowner\fR:\fIgroup\fR:\fImode\fR:\fItarget_file\fR:\fIsource\fR:

 File with zeros
 \fBz\fR:\fIowner\fR:\fIgroup\fR:\fImode\fR:\fItarget_file\fR:\fIsize\fR:

 Named Pipes
 \fBp\fR:\fIowner\fR:\fIgroup\fR:\fImode\fR:\fItarget_fifo\fR::

 Device files
 \fBc\fR:\fIowner\fR:\fIgroup\fR:\fImode\fR:target_device:devnum:
.EE

\fBinstaller\fR silently ignores comments, blank lines or any line starting
with any white space character.

\fBinstaller\fR is not meant to be executed by end users. It is meant to be
used to be used in Makefile and build scripts to install binaries, links,
named pipes, devices and files with zeros to a destination directory.

\fBinstcheck\fR checks the existence of files and ower, group, mode of
installed files. It needs the same input as \fBinstcheck\fR on descriptor
0. \fBinstcheck\fR is just a frontend to \fBinstaller\fR, except that it
uses input file started in \fI@sysconfdir@/perms.d/package\fR. A special
file named \fIINPUT\fR is present in the director under
\fIpackage/INPUT\fR. Here \fIpackage\fR refers to binary packages which use
\fBinstaller\fR to do the installation - \fBdaemontools\fR,
\fBucspi-tcp\fR, \fBindimail-mta\fR, \fBtinydnssec\fR. e.g., the following
command will check and fix permissions for each and every file that is part
of the \fBdaemontools\fR package.

.EX
  instcheck -cf daemontools < @sysconfdir@/perms.d/daemontools/INPUT
.EE

An alternate of using instcheck is to rename it to \fBinstcheck.package\fR.
e.g., if \fBinstcheck\fR is renamed as \fBinstcheck.indimail-mta\fR,
running the command \fBinstcheck.indimail-mta\fR will check and fix all
file part of the indimail-mta package.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP 3
\fB\-c\fR
This turns on check mode where installer checks the existence, owner, group
and permission mode of the \fItarget\fR.

.TP 3
\fB\-f\fR
This option turns on check mode as well as fix mode where owner, group or
mode of the \fItarget\fR is fixed.

.TP 3
\fB\-u\fR
Uninstall \fItarget\fR from \fIdest\fR.

.TP 3
\fB\-m\fR
Continue if there is an error with reading source file. This option can be
used when \fItype\fR is \fIf\fR. For other file types, this option has no
effect.
