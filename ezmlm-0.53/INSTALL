Like any other piece of software (and information generally), ezmlm
comes with NO WARRANTY.


Things you have to decide before starting:

* Where programs will be installed, normally /usr/local/bin/ezmlm. To
change this directory, edit conf-bin now.

* Where man pages will be installed, normally /usr/local/man. To change
this directory, edit conf-man now.

* Where the qmail home directory is, normally /var/qmail. To change this
directory, edit conf-qmail now.


How to install:

 1. Compile the programs:
       % make
 2. Format the man pages:
       % make man
 3. Install the programs and man pages:
       # make setup


How to test:

 4. Make sure ezmlm-make is in your path. Create a mailing list:
       % ezmlm-make ~/testlist ~/.qmail-testlist me-testlist host
    Replace ``me'' and ``host'' with your e-mail address.
 5. Subscribe yourself to the list manually:
       % ezmlm-sub ~/testlist me@host
 6. Send a message to the list:
       % echo subject:testing | qmail-inject me-testlist@host
    You should receive a copy of the message at me@host.
 7. View the list membership:
       % ezmlm-list ~/testlist
    You should see just one line, containing your address.
 8. Unsubscribe yourself through e-mail:
       % qmail-inject me-testlist-unsubscribe@host < /dev/null
    When you receive the confirmation number, reply to complete your
    unsubscription. Use ezmlm-list to check that the list is empty.
 9. Retrieve the first message from the archive:
       % qmail-inject me-testlist-get.1@host < /dev/null
    You should receive a copy of your subject:testing message.


That's it! To report success:
       % ( echo 'First M. Last'; cat `cat SYSDEPS` ) \
         | mail djb-qst@koobera.math.uic.edu
Replace First M. Last with your name.
