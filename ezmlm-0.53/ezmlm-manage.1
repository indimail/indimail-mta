.SH NAME
ezmlm-manage \- automatically manage a mailing list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ezmlm-manage
.I dir
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-manage
handles administrative requests for the mailing list
stored in
.IR dir .

.B ezmlm-manage
is normally invoked from a
.B .qmail
file.
It reads a mail message from its standard input,
and a mail envelope from the
.BR SENDER ,
.BR LOCAL ,
and
.BR HOST
environment variables.

.B ezmlm-manage
expects
.B LOCAL
to be of the form
.IR list\fB-\fIaction\fB-\fIbox\fB=\fIdomain .
Here
.I list
is the first line of
.IR dir\fB/inlocal ,
.I action
is a request,
and
.I box\fB@\fIdomain
is the target of the request.
.B ezmlm-manage
sends a response to the target.
It attaches the original message to the end of its response.

.B LOCAL
may instead be of the form
.IR list\fB-\fIaction .
Then the envelope sender
is used as the target.

.B ezmlm-manage
expects
.B HOST
to match the first line of
.IR dir\fB/inhost .

.B ezmlm-manage
copies
.I dir\fB/mailinglist
into a
.B Mailing-List
field in its response.
If the incoming message has a
.B Mailing-List
field,
.B ezmlm-manage
refuses to respond.
.B ezmlm-manage
also refuses to respond to bounce messages.
.SH SUBSCRIPTIONS
If
.I action
is
.BR sc.\fIcookie ,
where
.I cookie
is an appropriate code
(depending on the target, the approximate time, and other factors),
.B ezmlm-manage
adds the target to the mailing list.

If
.I action
is
.BR subscribe ,
.B ezmlm-manage
does not subscribe the target,
but it identifies the right
.BR sc.\fIcookie
address in its response.

This confirmation mechanism
(1) verifies that the target is reachable 
and
(2) protects the target against forged subscription requests.

Actions of
.B uc.\fIcookie
and
.B unsubscribe
are used in the same way to delete the target from the mailing list.

If
.I dir\fB/public
does not exist,
.B ezmlm-manage
rejects all subscription and unsubscription attempts.
.SH "ARCHIVE RETRIEVALS"
If
.I action
is
.BR get.\fInum ,
.B ezmlm-manage
sends back message
.I num
from
.IR dir\fB/archive .

If
.I dir\fB/public
does not exist,
.B ezmlm-manage
rejects all archive retrieval attempts.
