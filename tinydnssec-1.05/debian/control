Description: a collection of Domain Name System tools
 This package includes software for all the fundamental DNS operations:
 .
 DNS cache: finding addresses of Internet hosts.  When a browser wants to
 contact www.yahoo.com, it first asks a DNS cache, such as djbdns's
 dnscache, to find the IP address of www.yahoo.com.  Internet service
 providers run dnscache to find IP addresses requested by their customers.
 If you're running a home computer or a workstation, you can run your own
 dnscache to speed up your web browsing.
 .
 DNS server: publishing addresses of Internet hosts.  The IP address of
 www.yahoo.com is published by Yahoo's DNS servers.  djbdns includes
 a general-purpose DNS server, tinydns; network administrators run tinydns
 to publish the IP addresses of their computers.  djbdns also includes
 special-purpose servers for publishing DNS walls and RBLs.
 .
 DNS client: talking to a DNS cache.  djbdns includes a DNS client C
 library and several command-line DNS client utilities.  Programmers use
 these tools to send requests to DNS caches.
 .
 djbdns also includes several DNS debugging tools, notably dnstrace, which
 administrators use to diagnose misconfigured remote servers.

 It also includes Dq, a package with DNS/DNSCurve related software.

 dqcache and also a commandline tool to debug DNS/DNScurve called dq.
