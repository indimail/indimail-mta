* Make hardcoded limit for EDNS0 response size configurable (environment).

* Add support for locations + timestamps to tinydns-sign (basically, treat
  them as separate zones, with timestamp-dependend SOA serials).

* Add support for ((semi-)automatic) ZSK rollover using pre-publish method.

* Refactor tinydns-sign:
  - separate generation of helper records
  - put some functionality into modules
  - make (better) use of existing Net::DNS modules
