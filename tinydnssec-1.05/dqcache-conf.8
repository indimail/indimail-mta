.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dqcache-conf 
.I acct
.I logacct
.I D
[
.I ip
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dqcache-conf
creates a service directory 
.I D
that runs
.BR dqcache (8).
The name 
.I D
must start with a slash
and must not contain any special characters.
Normally 
.I D
is 
.IR /etc/indimail/dqcache .

You can run the service under
.BR svscan (8)
by creating a symbolic link in the 
.BR svscan (8)
directory:

ln -s 
.I D
/service

The service will start within five seconds,
and will be restarted upon reboot.
You can use
.BR svc (8)
to control the service.

.B indimail/dqcache-conf
arranges for 
.BR dqcache (8)
to chroot to 
.IR D /root
and to run under the uid and gid of 
.IR acct .
The name
.I acct
must not contain any special characters.

.B dqcache-conf
arranges for 
.BR dqcache (8)
to listen for UDP packets and TCP connections on port 53 of 
.IR ip .

.I ip
is optional;
if it is not supplied,
.B dqcache-conf
arranges for 
.BR dqcache (8)
to listen on 127.0.0.1.

.B dqcache-conf
creates 
.IR D /root/ip/127.0.0.1
so that 
.BR dqcache (8)
will accept queries from 127.0.0.1.

.B dqcache-conf
puts 128 bytes of not-particularly-secret data
into 
.IR D /seed
and arranges for 
.BR dqcache (8)
to pass 
.IR D /seed
to 
.BR dns_random_init (3).
If your system has a good source of random data,
you can replace 
.IR D /seed
with 128 bytes of data from that source.

.B dqcache-conf
creates an automatically rotated log directory in
.IR D /log/main.
The logs are owned by 
.IR logacct .
The corresponding 
.BR multilog (8)
processes run under the uid and gid of 
.IR logacct .
The name 
.I logacct
must not contain any special characters.
