                  CurveDNS INSTALL
=====================================================

For the latest and detailed installation instructions 
see http://curvedns.on2it.net/docs#install



For people in a hurry, a (very) short instruction:

 1) Be sure to have libev (+ dev headers) installed
 2) ./configure.nacl      -- takes a while
 3) ./configure.curvedns  -- answer possible questions
 4) make
 5) Copy both curvedns and curvedns-keygen to your 
      preferred path.
