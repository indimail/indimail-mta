.SH NAME
pickdns \- A load-balancing DNS server.

\fBpickdns\fR is a load-balancing DNS server. It accepts iterative DNS queries from hosts around the Internet, and
responds with a dynamic selection of locally configured IP addresses with 5-second TTLs.
In versions 1.04 and above, the features of pickdns have been integrated into tinydns.

.SH Configuration

Normally pickdns is set up by the pickdns-conf program.
pickdns runs chrooted in the directory specified by the $ROOT environment variable, under the uid and gid
specified by the $UID and $GID environment variables.

pickdns listens for incoming UDP packets addressed to port 53 of $IP. It does not listen for TCP queries.

pickdns rejects inverse queries, non-Internet-class queries, truncated packets, packets that contain anything
other than a single query, and query types other than A or MX or *. It looks up other queries inside data.cdb,
a binary file created by pickdns-data.
