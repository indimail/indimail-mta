     <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>fetchmail</B> is a mail-retrieval and forwarding utility; it fetches
mail from remote mailservers and forwards it to your local (client)
machine&#146;s delivery system.  You can then handle the retrieved mail using
normal mail user agents such as <B>mutt</B>(1), <B>elm</B>(1) or
<B>Mail</B>(1).  The <B>fetchmail</B> utility can be run in a daemon mode
to repeatedly poll one or more systems at a specified interval.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The <B>fetchmail</B> program can gather mail from servers supporting any
of the common mail-retrieval protocols: POP2 (legacy, to be removed from
future release), POP3, IMAP2bis, IMAP4, and IMAP4rev1.  It can also use
the ESMTP ETRN extension and ODMR.  (The RFCs describing all these
protocols are listed at the end of this manual page.)
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
While <B>fetchmail</B> is primarily intended to be used over on-demand
TCP/IP links (such as SLIP or PPP connections), it may also be useful as
a message transfer agent for sites which refuse for security reasons to
permit (sender-initiated) SMTP transactions with sendmail.

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; CONCEPTS</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If <B>fetchmail</B> is used with a POP or an IMAP server (but not with
ETRN or ODMR), it has two fundamental modes of operation for each user
account from which it retrieves mail: <I>singledrop</I>- and
<I>multidrop</I>-mode.
<!-- .IP "In singledrop-mode," -->
<TABLE cellpadding=3><!-- tsb: If <B>fetchmail</B> is used with a POP or an IMAP server (but not with
 -->
<TR></TR><TR></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>
In singledrop-mode,
</TD><TD>
<B>fetchmail</B> assumes that all messages in the user&#146;s account
(mailbox) are intended for a single recipient.  The identity of the
recipient will either default to the local user currently executing
<B>fetchmail</B>, or will need to be explicitly specified in the
configuration file.
<!-- .IP -->
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>

</TD><TD>
<B>fetchmail</B> uses singledrop-mode when the fetchmailrc configuration
contains at most a single local user specification for a given server
account.
<!-- .IP "In multidrop-mode," -->
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>
In multidrop-mode,
</TD><TD>
<B>fetchmail</B> assumes that the mail server account actually contains
mail intended for any number of different recipients.  Therefore,
<B>fetchmail</B> must attempt to deduce the proper "envelope recipient"
from the mail headers of each message.  In this mode of operation,
<B>fetchmail</B> almost resembles a mail transfer agent (MTA).
<!-- .IP -->
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>

</TD><TD>
Note that neither the POP nor IMAP protocols were intended for use in
this fashion, and hence envelope information is often not directly
available.  The ISP must stores the envelope information in some message
header <B>and</B>. The ISP must also store one copy of the message per
recipient. If either of the conditions is not fulfilled, this process is
unreliable, because <B>fetchmail</B> must then resort to guessing the
true envelope recipient(s) of a message. This usually fails for mailing
list messages and Bcc:d mail, or mail for multiple recipients in your
domain.
<!-- .IP -->
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>

</TD><TD>
<B>fetchmail</B> uses multidrop-mode when more than one local user and/or
a wildcard is specified for a particular server account in the
configuration file.
<!-- .IP "In ETRN and ODMR modes," -->
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>
In ETRN and ODMR modes,
</TD><TD>
these considerations do not apply, as these protocols are based on SMTP,
which provides explicit envelope recipient information. These protocols
always support multiple recipients.
<!-- .PP -->
</TD></TR>
<!-- PP ends table -->
<TR></TR></TABLE>As each message is retrieved, <B>fetchmail</B> normally delivers it via
SMTP to port 25 on the machine it is running on (localhost), just as
though it were being passed in over a normal TCP/IP link.
<B>fetchmail</B> provides the SMTP server with an envelope recipient
derived in the manner described previously.  The mail will then be
delivered according to your MTA&#146;s rules (the Mail Transfer Agent is
usually <B>sendmail</B>(8), <B>exim</B>(8), or <B>postfix</B>(8)).
Invoking your system&#146;s MDA (Mail Delivery Agent) is the duty of your
MTA.  All the delivery-control mechanisms (such as <I>.forward</I> files)
normally available through your system MTA and local delivery agents
will therefore be applied as usual.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
If your fetchmail configuration sets a local MDA (see the --mda
option), it will be used directly instead of talking SMTP to port 25.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
If the program <B>fetchmailconf</B> is available, it will assist you in
setting up and editing a fetchmailrc configuration.  It runs under the X
window system and requires that the language Python and the Tk toolkit
(with Python bindings) be present on your system.  If you are first
setting up fetchmail for single-user mode, it is recommended that you
use Novice mode.  Expert mode provides complete control of fetchmail
configuration, including the multidrop features.  In either case,
the &#146;Autoprobe&#146; button will tell you the most capable protocol a given
mailserver supports, and warn you of potential problems with that
server.

<!-- .SH GENERAL OPERATION -->
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=5>

     <H3>GENERAL OPERATION</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The behavior of <B>fetchmail</B> is controlled by command-line options and a
run control file, <I>~/.fetchmailrc</I>,
the syntax of which we describe in a later section (this file is what
the <B>fetchmailconf</B> program edits).  Command-line options override
<I>~/.fetchmailrc</I> declarations.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Each server name that you specify following the options on the command
line will be queried.  If you don&#146;t specify any servers on the command
line, each &#146;poll&#146; entry in your <I>~/.fetchmailrc</I> file will be
queried.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
To facilitate the use of <B>fetchmail</B> in scripts and pipelines, it
returns an appropriate exit code upon termination -- see EXIT CODES
below.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The following options modify the behavior of <B>fetchmail</B>.  It is
seldom necessary to specify any of these once you have a
working <I>.fetchmailrc</I> file set up.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Almost all options have a corresponding keyword which can be used to
declare them in a <I>.fetchmailrc</I> file.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Some special options are not covered here, but are documented instead
in sections on AUTHENTICATION and DAEMON MODE which follow.

Return a status code to indicate whether there is mail waiting,

This option turns off daemon mode (in which it would be useless).  It
doesn&#146;t play well with queries to multiple sites, and doesn&#146;t work
with ETRN or ODMR.  It will return a false positive if you leave read but
undeleted mail in your server mailbox and your fetch protocol can&#146;t
tell kept messages from new ones.  This means it will work with IMAP,
not work with POP2, and may occasionally flake out under POP3.

Retrieve both old (seen) and new messages from the mailserver.  The
default is to fetch only messages the server has not marked seen.
Under POP3, this option also forces the use of RETR rather than TOP.
Note that POP2 retrieval behaves as though --all is always on (see
RETRIEVAL FAILURE MODES below) and this option does not work with ETRN
or ODMR.  While the -a and --all command-line and fetchall rcfile
options have been supported for a long time, the --fetchall

Keep retrieved messages on the remote mailserver.  Normally, messages
are deleted from the folder on the mailserver after they have been retrieved.
Specifying the <B>keep</B> option causes retrieved messages to remain in
your folder on the mailserver.  This option does not work with ETRN or
ODMR. If used with POP3, it is recommended to also specify the --uidl
option or uidl keyword.

Delete retrieved messages from the remote mailserver.  This

POP3/IMAP only.  This is a dangerous option and can cause mail loss when
used improperly. It deletes old (seen) messages from the mailserver
before retrieving new messages.  <B>Warning:</B> This can cause mail loss if
you check your mail with other clients than fetchmail, and cause
fetchmail to delete a message it had never fetched before.  It can also
cause mail loss if the mail server marks the message seen after
retrieval (IMAP2 servers). You should probably not use this option in your
configuration file. If you use it with POP3, you must use the &#146;uidl&#146;
option. What you probably want is the default setting: if you don&#146;t
specify &#146;-k&#146;, then fetchmail will automatically delete messages after

All these alternatives work in basically the same way (communicating
with standard server daemons to fetch mail already delivered to a
mailbox on the server) except ETRN and ODMR.  The ETRN mode
allows you to ask a compliant ESMTP server (such as BSD sendmail at
release 8.8.0 or higher) to immediately open a sender-SMTP connection
to your client machine and begin forwarding any items addressed to
your client machine in the server&#146;s queue of undelivered mail.   The
ODMR mode requires an ODMR-capable server and works similarly to
ETRN, except that it does not require the client machine to have
a static DNS.

news drop for a group of users. The fact that seen messages are skipped
is logged, unless error logging is done through syslog while running in
daemon mode.  Note that fetchmail may automatically enable this option

may be removed and forced enabled in a future fetchmail version. See

supported for a long time, the --idle command-line option was added in

The principal option permits you to specify a service principal for

(Keyword: timeout)
<!-- .br -->
<!-- Need break --><BR>
The timeout option allows you to set a server-nonresponse
timeout in seconds.  If a mailserver does not send a greeting message
or respond to commands for the given number of seconds,
<B>fetchmail</B> will drop the connection to it.  Without such a timeout
<B>fetchmail</B> might hang until the TCP connection times out, trying to fetch
mail from a down host, which may be very long.
This would be particularly annoying for a <B>fetchmail</B> running in the
background.  There is a default timeout which fetchmail~-V will report.  If a
given connection receives too many timeouts in succession, fetchmail will
consider it wedged and stop retrying.  The calling user will be notified by
email if this happens.
<!-- .IP -->

<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>

</TD><TD>
Beginning with fetchmail 6.3.10, the SMTP client uses the recommended minimum
timeouts from RFC-5321 while waiting for the SMTP/LMTP server it is talking to.
You can raise the timeouts even more, but you cannot shorten them. This is to
avoid a painful situation where fetchmail has been configured with a short
timeout (a minute or less), ships a long message (many MBytes) to the local
MTA, which then takes longer than timeout to respond "OK", which it eventually
will; that would mean the mail gets delivered properly, but fetchmail cannot
notice it and will thus refetch this big message over and over again.

The plugin option allows you to use an external program to establish the TCP

(note that the interpolation logic is rather primitive, and these tokens must
be bounded by whitespace or beginning of string or end of string).
Fetchmail will write to the plugin&#146;s stdin and read from the plugin&#146;s

the hostname by which it is reached, and by default fetchmail will

fingerprint with the given one, and the connection will fail if they do not
match regardless of the <B>sslcertck</B> setting. The connection will
also fail if fetchmail cannot obtain an SSL certificate from the server.
This can be used to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, but the finger
print from the server needs to be obtained or verified over a secure

This option lets <B>fetchmail</B> use a Message or Local Delivery Agent
(MDA or LDA) directly, rather than forward via SMTP or LMTP.
<P>
To avoid losing mail, use this option only with MDAs like maildrop or
MTAs like sendmail that exit with a nonzero status on disk-full and other
delivery errors; the nonzero status tells fetchmail that delivery failed
and prevents the message from being deleted on the server.
<P>
If <B>fetchmail</B> is running as root, it sets its user id while
delivering mail through an MDA as follows:  First, the FETCHMAILUSER,
LOGNAME, and USER environment variables are checked in this order. The
value of the first variable from his list that is defined (even if it is
empty!) is looked up in the system user database. If none of the
variables is defined, fetchmail will use the real user id it was started
with. If one of the variables was defined, but the user stated there
isn&#146;t found, fetchmail continues running as root, without checking
remaining variables on the list.  Practically, this means that if you
run fetchmail as root (not recommended), it is most useful to define the
FETCHMAILUSER environment variable to set the user that the MDA should
run as. Some MDAs (such as maildrop) are designed to be setuid root and
setuid to the recipient&#146;s user id, so you don&#146;t lose functionality this
way even when running fetchmail as unprivileged user.  Check the MDA&#146;s
manual for details.
<P>
Some possible MDAs are "/usr/sbin/sendmail -i -f %F -- %T"
(<B>Note:</B>
some several older or vendor sendmail versions mistake -- for an
address, rather than an indicator to mark the end of the option arguments),
"/usr/bin/deliver" and "/usr/bin/maildrop -d %T".  Local delivery
addresses will be inserted into the MDA command wherever you place a
%T; the mail message&#146;s From address will be inserted where you place
an %F.
<P>
<B>Do NOT enclose the %F or %T string in single quotes!</B>
For both %T and %F, fetchmail encloses the addresses in single quotes
(&#146;), after removing any single quotes they may contain, before the MDA
command is passed to the shell.
<P>
<B>Do NOT use an MDA invocation that dispatches on the contents of
To/Cc/Bcc,</B> like "sendmail -i -t" or "qmail-inject", it will create
mail loops and bring the just wrath of many postmasters down upon your
head.  This is one of the most frequent configuration errors!
<P>
Also, do <I>not</I> try to combine multidrop mode with an MDA such
as maildrop that can only accept one address, unless your upstream
stores one copy of the message per recipient and transports the envelope
recipient in a header; you will lose mail.
<P>
The well-known
<!-- .BR procmail (1) -->
<B>procmail</B>(1)
package is very hard to configure properly, it has a very nasty "fall
through to the next rule" behavior on delivery errors (even temporary
ones, such as out of disk space if another user&#146;s mail daemon copies the
mailbox around to purge old messages), so your mail will end up in the
wrong mailbox sooner or later. The proper procmail configuration is
outside the scope of this document. Using
<!-- .BR maildrop (1) -->
<B>maildrop</B>(1)
is usually much easier, and many users find the filter syntax used by
maildrop easier to understand.
<P>
Finally, we strongly advise that you do <B>not</B> use qmail-inject.  The
command line interface is non-standard without providing benefits for
typical use, and fetchmail makes no attempts to accommodate
qmail-inject&#146;s deviations from the standard. Some of qmail-inject&#146;s
command-line and environment options are actually dangerous and can
cause broken threads, non-detected duplicate messages and forwarding
loops.

i. e. headers with bad syntax. Traditionally, fetchmail has rejected such
messages, but some distributors modified fetchmail to accept them. You can now
configure fetchmail&#146;s behaviour per server.

<!-- .br -->
<!-- Need break --><BR>
Takes a maximum octet size argument, where 0 is the
default and also the special value designating "no limit".
If nonzero, messages larger than this size will not be fetched and will
be left on the server (in foreground sessions, the progress messages
will note that they are "oversized").  If the fetch protocol permits (in
particular, under IMAP or POP3 without the fetchall option) the message
will not be marked seen.
<!-- .sp -->
<P>
An explicit --limit of 0 overrides any limits set in your
run control file. This option is intended for those needing to
strictly control fetch time due to expensive and variable phone rates.
<!-- .sp -->

Combined with --limitflush, it can be used to delete oversized
messages waiting on a server.  In daemon mode, oversize notifications
are mailed to the calling user (see the --warnings option). This
option does not work with ETRN or ODMR.

(Keyword: warnings)
<!-- .br -->
<!-- Need break --><BR>
Takes an interval in seconds.  When you call <B>fetchmail</B>
with a &#146;limit&#146; option in daemon mode, this controls the interval at
which warnings about oversized messages are mailed to the calling user
(or the user specified by the &#146;postmaster&#146; option).  One such
notification is always mailed at the end of the the first poll that
the oversized message is detected.  Thereafter, re-notification is
suppressed until after the warning interval elapses (it will take
place at the end of the first following poll).

Specify the maximum number of messages that will be shipped to an SMTP
listener before the connection is deliberately torn down and rebuilt
(defaults to 0, meaning no limit).  An explicit --batchlimit of 0
overrides any limits set in your run control file.  While
<B>sendmail</B>(8) normally initiates delivery of a message immediately
after receiving the message terminator, some SMTP listeners are not so
prompt.  MTAs like <B>smail</B>(8) may wait till the
delivery socket is shut down to deliver.  This may produce annoying
delays when <B>fetchmail</B> is processing very large batches.  Setting
the batch limit to some nonzero size will prevent these delays.  This
option does not work with ETRN or ODMR.

<!-- Need break --><BR>
Limit the number of sizes of messages accepted from a given server in
a single transaction.  This option is useful in reducing the delay in
downloading the first mail when there are too many mails in the
mailbox.  By default, the limit is 100.  If set to 0, sizes of all
messages are downloaded at the start.

(Keyword: fastuidl)
<!-- .br -->
<!-- Need break --><BR>
Do a binary instead of linear search for the first unseen UID. Binary
search avoids downloading the UIDs of all mails. This saves time
(especially in daemon mode) where downloading the same set of UIDs in
each poll is a waste of bandwidth. The number &#146;n&#146; indicates how rarely
a linear search should be done. In daemon mode, linear search is used
once followed by binary searches in &#146;n-1&#146; polls if &#146;n&#146; is greater than
1; binary search is always used if &#146;n&#146; is 1; linear search is always
used if &#146;n&#146; is 0. In non-daemon mode, binary search is used if &#146;n&#146; is
1; otherwise linear search is used. The default value of &#146;n&#146; is 4.

(Keyword: expunge)
<!-- .br -->
<!-- Need break --><BR>
Arrange for deletions to be made final after a given number of
messages.  Under POP2 or POP3, fetchmail cannot make deletions final
without sending QUIT and ending the session -- with this option on,
fetchmail will break a long mail retrieval session into multiple
sub-sessions, sending QUIT after each sub-session. This is a good
defense against line drops on POP3 servers.  Under IMAP,
<B>fetchmail</B> normally issues an EXPUNGE command after each deletion
in order to force the deletion to be done immediately.  This is safest
when your connection to the server is flaky and expensive, as it avoids
resending duplicate mail after a line hit.  However, on large
mailboxes the overhead of re-indexing after every message can slam the
server pretty hard, so if your connection is reliable it is good to do
expunges less frequently.  Also note that some servers enforce a delay
of a few seconds after each quit, so fetchmail may not be able to get
back in immediately after an expunge -- you may see "lock busy" errors
if this happens. If you specify this option to an integer N,
it tells <B>fetchmail</B> to only issue expunges on every Nth delete.  An
argument of zero suppresses expunges entirely (so no expunges at all
will be done until the end of run).  This option does not work with ETRN
or ODMR.

(Keyword: interface)
<!-- .br -->
<!-- Need break --><BR>
Require that a specific interface device be up and have a specific local
or remote IPv4 (IPv6 is not supported by this option yet) address (or
range) before polling.  Frequently <B>fetchmail</B>
is used over a transient point-to-point TCP/IP link established directly
to a mailserver via SLIP or PPP.  That is a relatively secure channel.
But when other TCP/IP routes to the mailserver exist (e.g. when the link
is connected to an alternate ISP), your username and password may be
vulnerable to snooping (especially when daemon mode automatically polls
for mail, shipping a clear password over the net at predictable
intervals).  The --interface option may be used to prevent this.  When
the specified link is not up or is not connected to a matching IP
address, polling will be skipped.  The format is:
<!-- .sp -->
<P>
<!-- .nf -->
<PRE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interface/iii.iii.iii.iii[/mmm.mmm.mmm.mmm]
<!-- .fi -->

<!-- .sp -->
<P>
The field before the first slash is the interface name (i.e. sl0, ppp0
etc.).  The field before the second slash is the acceptable IP address.
The field after the second slash is a mask which specifies a range of
IP addresses to accept.  If no mask is present 255.255.255.255 is
assumed (i.e. an exact match).  This option is currently only supported
under Linux and FreeBSD. Please see the <B>monitor</B> section for below
for FreeBSD specific information.

(Keyword: monitor)
<!-- .br -->
<!-- Need break --><BR>
Daemon mode can cause transient links which are automatically taken down
after a period of inactivity (e.g. PPP links) to remain up
indefinitely.  This option identifies a system TCP/IP interface to be
monitored for activity.  After each poll interval, if the link is up but
no other activity has occurred on the link, then the poll will be
skipped.  However, when fetchmail is woken up by a signal, the
monitor check is skipped and the poll goes through unconditionally.
This option is currently only supported under Linux and FreeBSD.
For the <B>monitor</B> and <B>interface</B> options to work for non root
users under FreeBSD, the fetchmail binary must be installed SGID kmem.
This would be a security hole, but fetchmail runs with the effective GID
set to that of the kmem group <I>only</I> when interface data is being
collected.

(Keyword: auth[enticate])
<!-- .br -->
<!-- Need break --><BR>
This option permits you to specify an authentication type (see USER
AUTHENTICATION below for details).  The possible values are <B>any</B>,
<B>password</B>, <B>kerberos_v5</B>, <B>kerberos</B> (or, for
excruciating exactness, <B>kerberos_v4</B>), <B>gssapi</B>,
<B>cram-md5</B>, <B>otp</B>, <B>ntlm</B>, <B>msn</B> (only for POP3),
<B>external</B> (only IMAP) and <B>ssh</B>.
When <B>any</B> (the default) is specified, fetchmail tries
first methods that don&#146;t require a password (EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, KERBEROS IV,
KERBEROS 5); then it looks for methods that mask your password
(CRAM-MD5, NTLM, X-OTP - note that MSN is only supported for POP3, but not
autoprobed); and only if the server doesn&#146;t
support any of those will it ship your password en clair.  Other values
may be used to force various authentication methods
(<B>ssh</B> suppresses authentication and is thus useful for IMAP PREAUTH).
(<B>external</B> suppresses authentication and is thus useful for IMAP EXTERNAL).
Any value other than <B>password</B>, <B>cram-md5</B>, <B>ntlm</B>,
<B>msn</B> or <B>otp</B> suppresses fetchmail&#146;s normal inquiry for a
password.  Specify <B>ssh</B> when you are using an end-to-end secure
connection such as an ssh tunnel; specify <B>external</B> when you use
TLS with client authentication and specify <B>gssapi</B> or
<B>kerberos_v4</B> if you are using a protocol variant that employs
GSSAPI or K4.  Choosing KPOP protocol automatically selects Kerberos
authentication.  This option does not work with ETRN.  GSSAPI service names are
in line with RFC-2743 and IANA registrations, see

Specify an alternate name for the .fetchids file used to save message

Normally, <B>fetchmail</B> edits RFC-822 address headers (To, From, Cc,
Bcc, and Reply-To) in fetched mail so that any mail IDs local to the
server are expanded to full addresses (@ and the mailserver hostname are
appended).  This enables replies on the client to get addressed
correctly (otherwise your mailer might think they should be addressed to
local users on the client machine!).  This option disables the rewrite.
(This option is provided to pacify people who are paranoid about having
an MTA edit mail headers and want to know they can prevent it, but it is
generally not a good idea to actually turn off rewrite.)
When using ETRN or ODMR, the rewrite option is ineffective.

In the configuration file, an enhanced syntax is used:
<!-- .br -->
<!-- Need break --><BR>
<B>envelope [&lt;count&gt;] &lt;line&gt;</B>
<!-- .sp -->
<P>
This option changes the header <B>fetchmail</B> assumes will carry a copy
of the mail&#146;s envelope address.  Normally this is &#146;X-Envelope-To&#146;.
Other typically found headers to carry envelope information are
&#146;X-Original-To&#146; and &#146;Delivered-To&#146;.  Now, since these headers are
not standardized, practice varies. See the discussion of multidrop
address handling below.  As a special case, &#146;envelope "Received"&#146;
enables parsing of sendmail-style Received lines.  This is the default,
but discouraged because it is not fully reliable.
<P>
Note that fetchmail expects the Received-line to be in a specific
format: It must contain "by <I>host</I> for <I>address</I>", where
<I>host</I> must match one of the mailserver names that fetchmail
recognizes for the account in question.
<!-- .sp -->
<P>
The optional count argument (only available in the configuration file)
determines how many header lines of this kind are skipped. A count of 1
means: skip the first, take the second. A count of 2 means: skip the
first and second, take the third, and so on.

<!-- .br -->
<!-- Need break --><BR>
The string prefix assigned to this option will be removed from the user
name found in the header specified with the <I>envelope</I> option
(<I>before</I> doing multidrop name mapping or localdomain checking,
if either is applicable). This option is useful if you are using
<B>fetchmail</B> to collect the mail for an entire domain and your ISP
(or your mail redirection provider) is using qmail.
One of the basic features of qmail is the <I>Delivered-To:</I>
message header.  Whenever qmail delivers a message to a local mailbox
it puts the username and hostname of the envelope recipient on this
line.  The major reason for this is to prevent mail loops.  To set up
qmail to batch mail for a disconnected site the ISP-mailhost will have
normally put that site in its &#146;Virtualhosts&#146; control file so it will
add a prefix to all mail addresses for this site. This results in mail
<!-- .\" The \&@\& tries to stop HTML converters from making a mailto URL here. -->
sent to &#146;username@userhost.userdom.dom.com&#146; having a
<I>Delivered-To:</I> line of the form:

<!-- Found tag TP -->
<TR><TD colspan=2>
The ISP can make the &#146;mbox-userstr-&#146; prefix anything they choose
but a string matching the user host name is likely.
By using the option &#146;envelope Delivered-To:&#146; you can make fetchmail reliably
identify the original envelope recipient, but you have to strip the
&#146;mbox-userstr-&#146; prefix to deliver to the correct user.
This is what this option is for.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Early versions of POP3 (RFC1081, RFC1225) supported a crude form of
independent authentication using the <I>.rhosts</I> file on the
mailserver side.  Under this RPOP variant, a fixed per-user ID
equivalent to a password was sent in clear over a link to a reserved
port, with the command RPOP rather than PASS to alert the server that it
should do special checking.  RPOP is supported by <B>fetchmail</B>
(you can specify &#146;protocol RPOP&#146; to have the program send &#146;RPOP&#146;
rather than &#146;PASS&#146;) but its use is strongly discouraged, and support
will be removed from a future fetchmail version.  This
facility was vulnerable to spoofing and was withdrawn in RFC1460.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
RFC1460 introduced APOP authentication.  In this variant of POP3,
you register an APOP password on your server host (on some servers, the
program to do this is called <B>popauth</B>(8)).  You put the same
password in your <I>~/.fetchmailrc</I> file.  Each time <B>fetchmail</B>
logs in, it sends an MD5 hash of your password and the server greeting
time to the server, which can verify it by checking its authorization
database.

and a <B>fetchmail</B>-specified amount of body lines. It is optional and
therefore not implemented by all servers, and some are known to
implement it improperly. On many servers however, the RETR command which
retrieves the full message with header and body, sets the "seen" flag
(for instance, in a web interface), whereas the TOP command does not do
that.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
<B>fetchmail</B> will always use the RETR command if "fetchall" is set.
<B>fetchmail</B> will also use the RETR command if "keep" is set and
"uidl" is unset.  Finally, <B>fetchmail</B> will use the RETR command on
Maillennium POP3/PROXY servers (used by Comcast) to avoid a deliberate
TOP misinterpretation in this server that causes message corruption.
<!-- .PP -->

In all other cases, <B>fetchmail</B> will use the TOP command. This

<B>Note</B> that this description is true for the current version of

If your <B>fetchmail</B> was built with Kerberos support and you specify
Kerberos authentication (either with --auth or the <I>.fetchmailrc</I>
option <B>authenticate kerberos_v4</B>) it will try to get a Kerberos
ticket from the mailserver at the start of each query.  Note: if
either the pollname or via name is &#146;hesiod&#146;, fetchmail will try to use
Hesiod to look up the mailserver.
<!-- .PP -->

If you use POP3 or IMAP with GSSAPI authentication, <B>fetchmail</B> will
expect the server to have RFC1731- or RFC1734-conforming GSSAPI

Kerberos V, so you&#146;re expected to already have a ticket-granting
ticket. You may pass a username different from your principal name
using the standard <B>--user</B> command or by the <I>.fetchmailrc</I>
option <B>user</B>.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
If your IMAP daemon returns the PREAUTH response in its greeting line,
fetchmail will notice this and skip the normal authentication step.
This can be useful, e.g. if you start imapd explicitly using ssh.
In this case you can declare the authentication value &#146;ssh&#146; on that
site entry to stop <I>.fetchmail</I> from asking you for a password
when it starts up.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
If you use client authentication with <I>TLS1</I> and your IMAP daemon
returns the <I>AUTH=EXTERNAL</I> response, fetchmail will notice this
and will use the authentication shortcut and will not send the

<BR>
 on that site to stop <B>fetchmail</B> from asking you for a password
when it starts up.
<!-- .PP -->

If you are using POP3, and the server issues a one-time-password

If you are using IMAP, Microsoft&#146;s NTLM authentication (used by Microsoft

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Note that fetchmail currently uses the OpenSSL library, which is
severely underdocumented, so failures may occur just because the
programmers are not aware of OpenSSL&#146;s requirement of the day.
For instance, since v6.3.16, fetchmail calls
OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms(), which is necessary to support certificates
with SHA256 on OpenSSL 0.9.8 -- this information is deeply hidden in the
documentation and not at all obvious.  Please do not hesitate to report
subtle SSL failures.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
You can access SSL encrypted services by specifying the --ssl option.
You can also do this using the "ssl" user option in the .fetchmailrc
file. With SSL encryption enabled, queries are initiated over a
connection after negotiating an SSL session, and the connection fails if
SSL cannot be negotiated.  Some services, such as POP3 and IMAP, have
different well known ports defined for the SSL encrypted services.  The
encrypted ports will be selected automatically when SSL is enabled and
no explicit port is specified. The --sslproto &#146;SSL3&#146; option should be
used to select the SSLv3 protocol (default if unset: v2 or v3).  Also,
the --sslcertck command line or sslcertck run control file option
should be used to force strict certificate checking - see below.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
If SSL is not configured, fetchmail will usually opportunistically try to use
STARTTLS. STARTTLS can be enforced by using --sslproto "TLS1". TLS
connections use the same port as the unencrypted version of the
protocol and negotiate TLS via special command. The --sslcertck
command line or sslcertck run control file option should be used to
force strict certificate checking - see below.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
<!-- .B \-\-sslcertck is recommended: -->
<B>--sslcertck is recommended:</B> When connecting to an SSL or TLS encrypted server, the
server presents a certificate to the client for validation.  The
certificate is checked to verify that the common name in the certificate
matches the name of the server being contacted and that the effective
and expiration dates in the certificate indicate that it is currently
valid.  If any of these checks fail, a warning message is printed, but
the connection continues.  The server certificate does not need to be
signed by any specific Certifying Authority and may be a "self-signed"
certificate. If the --sslcertck command line option or sslcertck run
control file option is used, fetchmail will instead abort if any of
these checks fail, because it must assume that there is a
man-in-the-middle attack in this scenario, hence fetchmail must not
expose cleartext passwords. Use of the sslcertck or --sslcertck option
is therefore advised.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Some SSL encrypted servers may request a client side certificate.  A client
side public SSL certificate and private SSL key may be specified.  If
requested by the server, the client certificate is sent to the server for
validation.  Some servers may require a valid client certificate and may
refuse connections if a certificate is not provided or if the certificate
is not valid.  Some servers may require client side certificates be signed
by a recognized Certifying Authority.  The format for the key files and
the certificate files is that required by the underlying SSL libraries
(OpenSSL in the general case).
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
A word of care about the use of SSL: While above mentioned
setup with self-signed server certificates retrieved over the wires
can protect you from a passive eavesdropper, it doesn&#146;t help against an
active attacker. It&#146;s clearly an improvement over sending the
passwords in clear, but you should be aware that a man-in-the-middle
attack is trivially possible (in particular with tools such as
<!-- .URL "http://monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/" "dsniff" , -->
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .URL -->
).  Use of strict certificate checking with a certification authority
recognized by server and client, or perhaps of an SSH tunnel (see below
for some examples) is preferable if you care seriously about the
security of your mailbox and passwords.

before</B> fetchmail is run, you can use the
<!-- .BR touch (1) -->
<B>touch</B>(1)
command with the filename as its sole argument to create it.
<!-- .br -->
<!-- Need break --><BR>
This option allows you to redirect status messages
into a specified logfile (follow the option with the logfile name).  The
logfile is opened for append, so previous messages aren&#146;t deleted.  This
is primarily useful for debugging configurations. Note that fetchmail
does not detect if the logfile is rotated, the logfile is only opened
once when fetchmail starts. You need to restart fetchmail after rotating
the logfile and before compressing it (if applicable).
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The
<!-- .B \-\-syslog -->
<B>--syslog</B> option (keyword: set syslog) allows you to redirect status and error
messages emitted to the
<!-- .BR syslog (3) -->
<B>syslog</B>(3)
system daemon if available.
Messages are logged with an id of <B>fetchmail</B>, the facility <B>LOG_MAIL</B>,
and priorities <B>LOG_ERR</B>, <B>LOG_ALERT</B> or <B>LOG_INFO</B>.
This option is intended for logging status and error messages which
indicate the status of the daemon and the results while fetching mail
from the server(s).
Error messages for command line options and parsing the <I>.fetchmailrc</I>
file are still written to stderr, or to the specified log file.
The
<!-- .B \-\-nosyslog -->
<B>--nosyslog</B> option turns off use of
<!-- .BR syslog (3), -->
<B>syslog</B>(3),
assuming it&#146;s turned on in the <I>~/.fetchmailrc</I> file.
This option is overridden, in certain situations, by <B>--logfile</B> (which
see).
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The
<!-- .B \-N -->
<B>-N</B> or
<!-- .B \-\-nodetach -->
<B>--nodetach</B> option suppresses backgrounding and detachment of the daemon process
from its control terminal.  This is useful for debugging or when
fetchmail runs as the child of a supervisor process such as
<!-- .BR init (8) -->
<B>init</B>(8)
or Gerrit Pape&#146;s
<!-- .BR runit (8). -->
<B>runit</B>(8).
Note that this also causes the logfile option to be ignored.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Note that while running in daemon mode polling a POP2 or IMAP2bis server,
transient errors (such as DNS failures or sendmail delivery refusals)
may force the fetchall option on for the duration of the next polling
cycle.  This is a robustness feature.  It means that if a message is
fetched (and thus marked seen by the mailserver) but not delivered
locally due to some transient error, it will be re-fetched during the
next poll cycle.  (The IMAP logic doesn&#146;t delete messages until
they&#146;re delivered, so this problem does not arise.)
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
If you touch or change the <I>~/.fetchmailrc</I> file while fetchmail is
running in daemon mode, this will be detected at the beginning of the
next poll cycle.  When a changed <I>~/.fetchmailrc</I> is detected,
fetchmail rereads it and restarts from scratch (using exec(2); no state
information is retained in the new instance).  Note that if fetchmail
needs to query for passwords, of that if you break the
<I>~/.fetchmailrc</I> file&#146;s syntax, the new instance will softly and
silently vanish away on startup.

Normally, fetchmail behaves like any other MTA would -- it generates a
Received header into each message describing its place in the chain of
transmission, and tells the MTA it forwards to that the mail came from
the machine fetchmail itself is running on.  If the invisible option
is on, the Received header is suppressed and fetchmail tries to spoof
the MTA it forwards to into thinking it came directly from the
mailserver host.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The
<!-- .B \-\-showdots -->
<B>--showdots</B> option (keyword: set showdots) forces fetchmail to show progress dots

<I>and</I> output goes to console. This option is ignored in --silent mode.
<!-- .PP -->

By specifying the
<!-- .B \-\-tracepolls -->
<B>--tracepolls</B> option, you can ask fetchmail to add information to the Received
header on the form "polling {label} account {user}", where {label} is
the account label (from the specified rcfile, normally ~/.fetchmailrc)
and {user} is the username which is used to log on to the mail
server. This header can be used to make filtering email where no
useful header information is available and you want mail from
different accounts sorted into different mailboxes (this could, for
example, occur if you have an account on the same server running a
mailing list, and are subscribed to the list using that account). The
default is not adding any such header.  In

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The protocols <B>fetchmail</B> uses to talk to mailservers are next to
bulletproof.  In normal operation forwarding to port 25, no message is
ever deleted (or even marked for deletion) on the host until the SMTP
listener on the client side has acknowledged to <B>fetchmail</B> that
the message has been either accepted for delivery or rejected due to a
spam block.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
When forwarding to an MDA, however, there is more possibility
of error.  Some MDAs are &#146;safe&#146; and reliably return a nonzero status
on any delivery error, even one due to temporary resource limits.
The
<!-- .BR maildrop (1) -->
<B>maildrop</B>(1)
program is like this; so are most programs designed as mail transport
agents, such as
<!-- .BR sendmail (1), -->
<B>sendmail</B>(1),
including the sendmail wrapper of Postfix and
<!-- .BR exim (1). -->
<B>exim</B>(1).
These programs give back a reliable positive acknowledgement and
can be used with the mda option with no risk of mail loss.  Unsafe
MDAs, though, may return 0 even on delivery failure.  If this
happens, you will lose mail.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The normal mode of <B>fetchmail</B> is to try to download only &#146;new&#146;
messages, leaving untouched (and undeleted) messages you have already
read directly on the server (or fetched with a previous <I>fetchmail
--keep</I>).  But you may find that messages you&#146;ve already read on the
server are being fetched (and deleted) even when you don&#146;t specify
--all.  There are several reasons this can happen.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
One could be that you&#146;re using POP2.  The POP2 protocol includes no
representation of &#146;new&#146; or &#146;old&#146; state in messages, so <B>fetchmail</B>
must treat all messages as new all the time.  But POP2 is obsolete, so
this is unlikely.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
A potential POP3 problem might be servers that insert messages
in the middle of mailboxes (some VMS implementations of mail are
rumored to do this).  The <B>fetchmail</B> code assumes that new
messages are appended to the end of the mailbox; when this is not true
it may treat some old messages as new and vice versa.  Using UIDL whilst
setting fastuidl 0 might fix this, otherwise, consider switching to IMAP.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Yet another POP3 problem is that if they can&#146;t make tempfiles in the
user&#146;s home directory, some POP3 servers will hand back an
undocumented response that causes fetchmail to spuriously report "No
mail".
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The IMAP code uses the presence or absence of the server flag &#92;Seen
to decide whether or not a message is new.  This isn&#146;t the right thing
to do, fetchmail should check the UIDVALIDITY and use UID, but it
doesn&#146;t do that yet. Under Unix, it counts on your IMAP server to notice
the BSD-style Status flags set by mail user agents and set the &#92;Seen
flag from them when appropriate.  All Unix IMAP servers we know of do
this, though it&#146;s not specified by the IMAP RFCs.  If you ever trip over
a server that doesn&#146;t, the symptom will be that messages you have
already read on your host will look new to the server.  In this
(unlikely) case, only messages you fetched with <I>fetchmail --keep</I>
will be both undeleted and marked old.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
In ETRN and ODMR modes, <B>fetchmail</B> does not actually retrieve messages;
instead, it asks the server&#146;s SMTP listener to start a queue flush
to the client via SMTP.  Therefore it sends only undelivered messages.

Comments begin with a &#146;#&#146; and extend through the end of the line.
Otherwise the file consists of a series of server entries or global
option statements in a free-format, token-oriented syntax.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
There are four kinds of tokens: grammar keywords, numbers
(i.e. decimal digit sequences), unquoted strings, and quoted strings.
A quoted string is bounded by double quotes and may contain
whitespace (and quoted digits are treated as a string).  Note that
quoted strings will also contain line feed characters if they run across
two or more lines, unless you use a backslash to join lines (see below).
An unquoted string is any whitespace-delimited token that is neither
numeric, string quoted nor contains the special characters &#146;,&#146;, &#146;;&#146;,
&#146;:&#146;, or &#146;=&#146;.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Any amount of whitespace separates tokens in server entries, but is
otherwise ignored. You may use backslash escape sequences (&#92;n for LF,
&#92;t for HT, &#92;b for BS, &#92;r for CR, &#92;<I>nnn</I> for decimal (where
nnn cannot start with a 0), &#92;0<I>ooo</I> for octal, and &#92;x<I>hh</I> for
hex) to embed non-printable characters or string delimiters in strings.
In quoted strings, a backslash at the very end of a line will cause the
backslash itself and the line feed (LF or NL, new line) character to be
ignored, so that you can wrap long strings. Without the backslash at the
line end, the line feed character would become part of the string.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
<B>Warning:</B>
while these resemble C-style escape sequences, they are not the same.
fetchmail only supports these eight styles. C supports more escape
sequences that consist of backslash (&#92;) and a single character, but
does not support decimal codes and does not require the leading 0 in
octal notation.  Example: fetchmail interprets &#92;233 the same as &#92;xE9
(Latin small letter e with acute), where C would interpret &#92;233 as
octal 0233 = &#92;x9B (CSI, control sequence introducer).
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Each server entry consists of one of the keywords &#146;poll&#146; or &#146;skip&#146;,
followed by a server name, followed by server options, followed by any
number of user (or username) descriptions, followed by user options.
Note: the most common cause of syntax errors is mixing up user and
server options or putting user options before the user descriptions.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
For backward compatibility, the word &#146;server&#146; is a synonym for &#146;poll&#146;.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
You can use the noise keywords &#146;and&#146;, &#146;with&#146;,
&#146;has&#146;, &#146;wants&#146;, and &#146;options&#146; anywhere in an entry to make
it resemble English.  They&#146;re ignored, but but can make entries much
easier to read at a glance.  The punctuation characters &#146;:&#146;, &#146;;&#146; and
&#146;,&#146; are also ignored.

The &#146;poll&#146; verb tells fetchmail to query this host when it is run with
no arguments.  The &#146;skip&#146; verb tells
<B>fetchmail</B>
not to poll this host unless it is explicitly named on the command
line.  (The &#146;skip&#146; verb allows you to experiment with test entries
safely, or easily disable entries for hosts that are temporarily down.)

In the .fetchmailrc file, the &#146;envelope&#146; string argument may be
preceded by a whitespace-separated number.  This number, if specified,
is the number of such headers to skip over (that is, an argument of 1
selects the second header of the given type).  This is sometime useful
for ignoring bogus envelope headers created by an ISP&#146;s local delivery
agent or internal forwards (through mail inspection systems, for
instance).

and &#146;no envelope&#146;.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The &#146;via&#146; option is for if you want to have more
than one configuration pointing at the same site.  If it is present,
the string argument will be taken as the actual DNS name of the
mailserver host to query.
This will override the argument of poll, which can then simply be a
distinct label for the configuration (e.g. what you would give on the
command line to explicitly query this host).
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The &#146;interval&#146; option (which takes a numeric argument) allows you to poll a
server less frequently than the basic poll interval.  If you say
&#146;interval N&#146; the server this option is attached to will only be
queried every N poll intervals.

Please ensure you read the section titled
<B>THE USE AND ABUSE OF MULTIDROP MAILBOXES </B>
if you intend to use multidrop mode.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The &#146;is&#146; or &#146;to&#146; keywords associate the following local (client)
name(s) (or server-name to client-name mappings separated by =) with
the mailserver user name in the entry.  If an is/to list has &#146;*&#146; as
its last name, unrecognized names are simply passed through. Note that
until <B>fetchmail</B> version 6.3.4 inclusively, these lists could only
contain local parts of user names (fetchmail would only look at the part
before the @ sign). <B>fetchmail</B> versions 6.3.5 and
newer support full addresses on the left hand side of these mappings,
and they take precedence over any &#146;localdomains&#146;, &#146;aka&#146;, &#146;via&#146; or
similar mappings.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
A single local name can be used to support redirecting your mail when
your username on the client machine is different from your name on the
mailserver.  When there is only a single local name, mail is forwarded
to that local username regardless of the message&#146;s Received, To, Cc,
and Bcc headers.  In this case,
<B>fetchmail</B>
never does DNS lookups.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
When there is more than one local name (or name mapping),
<B>fetchmail</B> looks at the envelope header, if configured, and
otherwise at the Received, To, Cc, and Bcc headers of retrieved mail
(this is &#146;multidrop mode&#146;).  It looks for addresses with hostname parts
that match your poll name or your &#146;via&#146;, &#146;aka&#146; or &#146;localdomains&#146;
options, and usually also for hostname parts which DNS tells it are
aliases of the mailserver.  See the discussion of &#146;dns&#146;, &#146;checkalias&#146;,
&#146;localdomains&#146;, and &#146;aka&#146; for details on how matching addresses are
handled.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
If <B>fetchmail</B> cannot match any mailserver usernames or
localdomain addresses, the mail will be bounced.
Normally it will be bounced to the sender, but if the &#146;bouncemail&#146;
global option is off, the mail will go to the local postmaster instead.
(see the &#146;postmaster&#146; global option). See also BUGS.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The &#146;dns&#146; option (normally on) controls the way addresses from
multidrop mailboxes are checked.  On, it enables logic to check each
host address that does not match an &#146;aka&#146; or &#146;localdomains&#146; declaration
by looking it up with DNS.  When a mailserver username is recognized
attached to a matching hostname part, its local mapping is added to
the list of local recipients.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The &#146;checkalias&#146; option (normally off) extends the lookups performed
by the &#146;dns&#146; keyword in multidrop mode, providing a way to cope with
remote MTAs that identify themselves using their canonical name, while
they&#146;re polled using an alias.
When such a server is polled, checks to extract the envelope address
fail, and <B>fetchmail</B> reverts to delivery using the To/Cc/Bcc
headers (See below &#146;Header vs. Envelope addresses&#146;).
Specifying this option instructs <B>fetchmail</B> to retrieve all the IP
addresses associated with both the poll name and the name used by the
remote MTA and to do a comparison of the IP addresses.  This comes in
handy in situations where the remote server undergoes frequent canonical
name changes, that would otherwise require modifications to the rcfile.
&#146;checkalias&#146; has no effect if &#146;no dns&#146; is specified in the rcfile.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The &#146;aka&#146; option is for use with multidrop mailboxes.  It allows you
to pre-declare a list of DNS aliases for a server.  This is an
optimization hack that allows you to trade space for speed.  When
<B>fetchmail</B>, while processing a multidrop mailbox, grovels through
message headers looking for names of the mailserver, pre-declaring
common ones can save it from having to do DNS lookups.  Note: the names
you give as arguments to &#146;aka&#146; are matched as suffixes -- if you specify
(say) &#146;aka netaxs.com&#146;, this will match not just a hostname netaxs.com,
but any hostname that ends with &#146;.netaxs.com&#146;; such as (say)
pop3.netaxs.com and mail.netaxs.com.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The &#146;localdomains&#146; option allows you to declare a list of domains
which fetchmail should consider local.  When fetchmail is parsing
address lines in multidrop modes, and a trailing segment of a host
name matches a declared local domain, that address is passed through
to the listener or MDA unaltered (local-name mappings are <I>not</I>
applied).
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
If you are using &#146;localdomains&#146;, you may also need to specify &#146;no
envelope&#146;, which disables <B>fetchmail</B>&#146;s normal attempt to deduce
an envelope address from the Received line or X-Envelope-To header or
whatever header has been previously set by &#146;envelope&#146;.  If you set &#146;no
envelope&#146; in the defaults entry it is possible to undo that in
individual entries by using &#146;envelope &lt;string&gt;&#146;.  As a special case,
&#146;envelope "Received"&#146; restores the default parsing of
Received lines.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The <B>password</B> option requires a string argument, which is the password
to be used with the entry&#146;s server.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The &#146;preconnect&#146; keyword allows you to specify a shell command to be
executed just before each time
<B>fetchmail</B>
establishes a mailserver connection.  This may be useful if you are
attempting to set up secure POP connections with the aid of
<!-- .BR ssh (1). -->
<B>ssh</B>(1).
If the command returns a nonzero status, the poll of that mailserver
will be aborted.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Similarly, the &#146;postconnect&#146; keyword similarly allows you to specify a
shell command to be executed just after each time a mailserver
connection is taken down.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The &#146;forcecr&#146; option controls whether lines terminated by LF only are
given CRLF termination before forwarding.  Strictly speaking RFC821
requires this, but few MTAs enforce the requirement it so this option
is normally off (only one such MTA, qmail, is in significant use at
time of writing).
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The &#146;stripcr&#146; option controls whether carriage returns are stripped
out of retrieved mail before it is forwarded.  It is normally not
necessary to set this, because it defaults to &#146;on&#146; (CR stripping
enabled) when there is an MDA declared but &#146;off&#146; (CR stripping
disabled) when forwarding is via SMTP.  If &#146;stripcr&#146; and &#146;forcecr&#146; are
both on, &#146;stripcr&#146; will override.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The &#146;pass8bits&#146; option exists to cope with Microsoft mail programs that
stupidly slap a "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit" on everything.  With
this option off (the default) and such a header present,
<B>fetchmail</B>
declares BODY=7BIT to an ESMTP-capable listener; this causes problems for
messages actually using 8-bit ISO or KOI-8 character sets, which will
be garbled by having the high bits of all characters stripped.  If
&#146;pass8bits&#146; is on,
<B>fetchmail</B>
is forced to declare BODY=8BITMIME to any ESMTP-capable listener.  If
the listener is 8-bit-clean (as all the major ones now are) the right
thing will probably result.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The &#146;dropstatus&#146; option controls whether nonempty Status and
X-Mozilla-Status lines are retained in fetched mail (the default) or
discarded.  Retaining them allows your MUA to see what messages (if
any) were marked seen on the server.  On the other hand, it can
confuse some new-mail notifiers, which assume that anything with a
Status line in it has been seen.  (Note: the empty Status lines
inserted by some buggy POP servers are unconditionally discarded.)
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The &#146;dropdelivered&#146; option controls whether Delivered-To headers will
be kept in fetched mail (the default) or discarded. These headers are
added by Qmail and Postfix mailservers in order to avoid mail loops but
may get in your way if you try to "mirror" a mailserver within the same
domain. Use with caution.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The &#146;mimedecode&#146; option controls whether MIME messages using the
quoted-printable encoding are automatically converted into pure 8-bit
data. If you are delivering mail to an ESMTP-capable, 8-bit-clean
listener (that includes all of the major MTAs like sendmail), then
this will automatically convert quoted-printable message headers and
data into 8-bit data, making it easier to understand when reading
mail. If your e-mail programs know how to deal with MIME messages,
then this option is not needed.  The mimedecode option is off by
default, because doing RFC2047 conversion on headers throws away
character-set information and can lead to bad results if the encoding
of the headers differs from the body encoding.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The &#146;idle&#146; option is intended to be used with IMAP servers supporting
the RFC2177 IDLE command extension, but does not strictly require it.
If it is enabled, and fetchmail detects that IDLE is supported, an
IDLE will be issued at the end of each poll.  This will tell the IMAP
server to hold the connection open and notify the client when new mail
is available.  If IDLE is not supported, fetchmail will simulate it by
periodically issuing NOOP. If you need to poll a link frequently, IDLE
can save bandwidth by eliminating TCP/IP connects and LOGIN/LOGOUT
sequences. On the other hand, an IDLE connection will eat almost all
of your fetchmail&#146;s time, because it will never drop the connection
and allow other polls to occur unless the server times out the IDLE.
It also doesn&#146;t work with multiple folders; only the first folder will
ever be polled.
<P>
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The &#146;properties&#146; option is an extension mechanism.  It takes a string
argument, which is ignored by fetchmail itself.  The string argument may be
used to store configuration information for scripts which require it.
In particular, the output of &#146;--configdump&#146; option will make properties
associated with a user entry readily available to a Python script.

--syslog in this case.  Also,
&#146;set daemon&#146; sets the poll interval as --daemon does.  This can be
overridden by a command-line --daemon option; in particular --daemon~0
can be used to force foreground operation. The &#146;set postmaster&#146;

no local matches.  Finally, &#146;set syslog&#146; sends log messages to

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; Fetchmail crashing</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are various ways in that fetchmail may "crash", i. e. stop
operation suddenly and unexpectedly. A "crash" usually refers to an
error condition that the software did not handle by itself. A well-known
failure mode is the "segmentation fault" or "signal 11" or "SIGSEGV" or
just "segfault" for short. These can be caused by hardware or by software
problems. Software-induced segfaults can usually be reproduced easily
and in the same place, whereas hardware-induced segfaults can go away if
the computer is rebooted, or powered off for a few hours, and can happen
in random locations even if you use the software the same way.

For solving hardware-induced segfaults, find the faulty component and repair or
replace it.

<!-- .SS Enabling fetchmail core dumps -->
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=40>

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; Enabling fetchmail core dumps</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
By default, fetchmail suppresses core dumps as these might contain
passwords and other sensitive information. For debugging fetchmail
crashes, obtaining a "stack backtrace" from a core dump is often the
quickest way to solve the problem, and when posting your problem on a
mailing list, the developers may ask you for a "backtrace".
<P>
1. To get useful backtraces, fetchmail needs to be installed without
getting stripped of its compilation symbols.  Unfortunately, most
binary packages that are installed are stripped, and core files from
symbol-stripped programs are worthless. So you may need to recompile
fetchmail. On many systems, you can type
<!-- .sp -->
<P>
<!-- .nf -->
<PRE>
        file &#145;which fetchmail&#145;
<!-- .fi -->
</PRE>
<!-- .sp -->
<P>
to find out if fetchmail was symbol-stripped or not. If yours was
unstripped, fine, proceed, if it was stripped, you need to recompile the
source code first. You do not usually need to install fetchmail in order
to debug it.
<P>
2. The shell environment that starts fetchmail needs to enable core
dumps. The key is the "maximum core (file) size" that can usually be
configured with a tool named "limit" or "ulimit". See the documentation
for your shell for details. In the popular bash shell, "ulimit -Sc
unlimited" will allow the core dump.
<P>
3. You need to tell fetchmail, too, to allow core dumps. To do
this, run fetchmail with the <B>-d0 -v</B> options.  It is often easier
to also add <B>--nosyslog -N</B> as well.
<P>
Finally, you need to reproduce the crash. You can just start fetchmail
from the directory where you compiled it by typing <B>./fetchmail</B>,
so the complete command line will start with <B>./fetchmail -Nvd0
--nosyslog</B> and perhaps list your other options.
<P>
After the crash, run your debugger to obtain the core dump.  The
debugger will often be GNU GDB, you can then type (adjust paths as
necessary) <B>gdb ./fetchmail fetchmail.core</B> and then, after GDB
has started up and read all its files, type <B>backtrace full</B>, save
the output (copy & paste will do, the backtrace will be read by a human)
and then type <B>quit</B> to leave gdb.
<B>Note:</B>
on some systems, the core
files have different names, they might contain a number instead of the
program name, or number and name, but it will usually have "core" as
part of their name.

     <H3>INTERACTION WITH RFC 822</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When trying to determine the originating address of a message,
fetchmail looks through headers in the following order:
<!-- .sp -->
<P>
<!-- .nf -->
<PRE>
        Return-Path:
        Resent-Sender: (ignored if it doesn&#146;t contain an @ or !)
        Sender: (ignored if it doesn&#146;t contain an @ or !)
        Resent-From:
        From:
        Reply-To:
        Apparently-From:
<!-- .fi -->
</PRE>
<!-- .sp -->
<P>
The originating address is used for logging, and to set the MAIL FROM
address when forwarding to SMTP.  This order is intended to cope
gracefully with receiving mailing list messages in multidrop mode. The
intent is that if a local address doesn&#146;t exist, the bounce message
won&#146;t be returned blindly to the author or to the list itself, but
rather to the list manager (which is less annoying).
<P>
In multidrop mode, destination headers are processed as follows:
First, fetchmail looks for the header specified by the &#146;envelope&#146; option
in order to determine the local recipient address. If the mail is
addressed to more than one recipient, the Received line won&#146;t contain
any information regarding recipient addresses.
<P>
Then fetchmail looks for the Resent-To:, Resent-Cc:, and Resent-Bcc:
lines.  If they exist, they should contain the final recipients and
have precedence over their To:/Cc:/Bcc: counterparts.  If the Resent-*
lines don&#146;t exist, the To:, Cc:, Bcc: and Apparently-To: lines are
looked for. (The presence of a Resent-To: is taken to imply that the
person referred by the To: address has already received the original
copy of the mail.)

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; Header vs. Envelope addresses</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The fundamental problem is that by having your mailserver toss several
peoples&#146; mail in a single maildrop box, you may have thrown away
potentially vital information about who each piece of mail was
actually addressed to (the &#146;envelope address&#146;, as opposed to the
header addresses in the RFC822 To/Cc headers - the Bcc is not available
at the receiving end).  This &#146;envelope address&#146; is the address you need
in order to reroute mail properly.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Sometimes
<B>fetchmail</B>
can deduce the envelope address.  If the mailserver MTA is
<B>sendmail</B>
and the item of mail had just one recipient, the MTA will have written
a &#146;by/for&#146; clause that gives the envelope addressee into its Received
header. But this doesn&#146;t work reliably for other MTAs, nor if there is
more than one recipient.  By default, <B>fetchmail</B> looks for
envelope addresses in these lines; you can restore this default with
-E "Received" or &#146;envelope Received&#146;.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
<B>As a better alternative,</B>
some SMTP listeners and/or mail servers insert a header
in each message containing a copy of the envelope addresses.  This
header (when it exists) is often &#146;X-Original-To&#146;, &#146;Delivered-To&#146; or
&#146;X-Envelope-To&#146;.  Fetchmail&#146;s assumption about this can be changed with
the -E or &#146;envelope&#146; option.  Note that writing an envelope header of
this kind exposes the names of recipients (including blind-copy
recipients) to all receivers of the messages, so the upstream must store
one copy of the message per recipient to avoid becoming a privacy problem.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Postfix, since version 2.0, writes an X-Original-To: header which
contains a copy of the envelope as it was received.

Qmail and Postfix generally write a &#146;Delivered-To&#146; header upon
delivering the message to the mail spool and use it to avoid mail loops.
Qmail virtual domains however will prefix the user name with a string
that normally matches the user&#146;s domain. To remove this prefix you can
use the -Q or &#146;qvirtual&#146; option.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Sometimes, unfortunately, neither of these methods works.  That is the
point when you should contact your ISP and ask them to provide such an
envelope header, and you should not use multidrop in this situation.
When they all fail, fetchmail must fall back on the contents of To/Cc
headers (Bcc headers are not available - see below) to try to determine
recipient addressees -- and these are unreliable.
In particular, mailing-list software often ships mail with only
the list broadcast address in the To header.

<B>Note that a future version of </B><B>fetchmail</B> may remove To/Cc parsing!

<P>
When
<B>fetchmail</B>
cannot deduce a recipient address that is local, and the intended

This is what makes the multidrop feature risky without proper envelope
information.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
A related problem is that when you blind-copy a mail message, the Bcc
information is carried <I>only</I> as envelope address (it&#146;s removed from
the headers by the sending mail server, so fetchmail can see it only if
there is an X-Envelope-To header).  Thus, blind-copying to someone who
gets mail over a fetchmail multidrop link will fail unless the the
mailserver host routinely writes X-Envelope-To or an equivalent header
into messages in your maildrop.

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; Good Ways To Use Multidrop Mailboxes</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Multiple local names can be used to administer a mailing list from the
client side of a <B>fetchmail</B> collection.  Suppose your name is
&#146;esr&#146;, and you want to both pick up your own mail and maintain a mailing
list called (say) "fetchmail-friends", and you want to keep the alias
list on your client machine.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
On your server, you can alias &#146;fetchmail-friends&#146; to &#146;esr&#146;; then, in
your <I>.fetchmailrc</I>, declare &#146;to esr fetchmail-friends here&#146;.
Then, when mail including &#146;fetchmail-friends&#146; as a local address
gets fetched, the list name will be appended to the list of
recipients your SMTP listener sees.  Therefore it will undergo alias
expansion locally.  Be sure to include &#146;esr&#146; in the local alias
expansion of fetchmail-friends, or you&#146;ll never see mail sent only to
the list.  Also be sure that your listener has the "me-too" option set
(sendmail&#146;s -oXm command-line option or OXm declaration) so your name
isn&#146;t removed from alias expansions in messages you send.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
This trick is not without its problems, however.  You&#146;ll begin to see
this when a message comes in that is addressed only to a mailing list
you do <I>not</I> have declared as a local name.  Each such message
will feature an &#146;X-Fetchmail-Warning&#146; header which is generated
because fetchmail cannot find a valid local name in the recipient
addresses.  Such messages default (as was described above) to being
sent to the local user running <B>fetchmail</B>, but the program has no
way to know that that&#146;s actually the right thing.

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; Bad Ways To Abuse Multidrop Mailboxes</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Multidrop mailboxes and
<B>fetchmail</B>
serving multiple users in daemon mode do not mix.  The problem, again, is
mail from mailing lists, which typically does not have an individual
recipient address on it.   Unless
<B>fetchmail</B>
can deduce an envelope address, such mail will only go to the account
running fetchmail (probably root).  Also, blind-copied users are very
likely never to see their mail at all.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
If you&#146;re tempted to use
<B>fetchmail</B>
to retrieve mail for multiple users from a single mail drop via POP or
IMAP, think again (and reread the section on header and envelope
addresses above).  It would be smarter to just let the mail sit in the
mailserver&#146;s queue and use fetchmail&#146;s ETRN or ODMR modes to trigger
SMTP sends periodically (of course, this means you have to poll more
frequently than the mailserver&#146;s expiry period).  If you can&#146;t arrange
this, try setting up a UUCP feed.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
If you absolutely <I>must</I> use multidrop for this purpose, make sure
your mailserver writes an envelope-address header that fetchmail can
see.  Otherwise you <I>will</I> lose mail and it <I>will</I> come back
to haunt you.

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; Speeding Up Multidrop Checking</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Normally, when multiple users are declared
<B>fetchmail</B>
extracts recipient addresses as described above and checks each host
part with DNS to see if it&#146;s an alias of the mailserver.  If so, the
name mappings described in the "to ... here" declaration are done and
the mail locally delivered.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
This is a convenient but also slow method.  To speed
it up, pre-declare mailserver aliases with &#146;aka&#146;; these are checked
before DNS lookups are done.  If you&#146;re certain your aka list contains
<B>all</B>
DNS aliases of the mailserver (and all MX names pointing at it - note
this may change in a future version)
you can declare &#146;no dns&#146; to suppress DNS lookups entirely and
<I>only</I> match against the aka list.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Please check the <B>NEWS</B> file that shipped with fetchmail for more
known bugs than those listed here.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Fetchmail cannot handle user names that contain blanks after a "@"
character, for instance "demonstr@ti on". These are rather uncommon and
only hurt when using UID-based --keep setups, so the 6.3.X versions of
fetchmail won&#146;t be fixed.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Fetchmail cannot handle configurations where you have multiple accounts
that use the same server name and the same login. Any user@server
combination must be unique.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The assumptions that the DNS and in particular the checkalias options
make are not often sustainable. For instance, it has become uncommon for
an MX server to be a POP3 or IMAP server at the same time. Therefore the
MX lookups may go away in a future release.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The mda and plugin options interact badly.  In order to collect error
status from the MDA, fetchmail has to change its normal signal
handling so that dead plugin processes don&#146;t get reaped until the end
of the poll cycle.  This can cause resource starvation if too many
zombies accumulate.  So either don&#146;t deliver to a MDA using plugins or
risk being overrun by an army of undead.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The --interface option does not support IPv6 and it is doubtful if it
ever will, since there is no portable way to query interface IPv6
addresses.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The RFC822 address parser used in multidrop mode chokes on some
@-addresses that are technically legal but bizarre.  Strange uses of
quoting and embedded comments are likely to confuse it.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
In a message with multiple envelope headers, only the last one
processed will be visible to fetchmail.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Use of some of these protocols requires that the program send
unencrypted passwords over the TCP/IP connection to the mailserver.
This creates a risk that name/password pairs might be snaffled with a
packet sniffer or more sophisticated monitoring software.  Under Linux
and FreeBSD, the --interface option can be used to restrict polling to
availability of a specific interface device with a specific local or
remote IP address, but snooping is still possible if (a) either host
has a network device that can be opened in promiscuous mode, or (b)
the intervening network link can be tapped.  We recommend the use of
<!-- .BR ssh (1) -->
<B>ssh</B>(1)
tunnelling to not only shroud your passwords but encrypt the entire
conversation.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Use of the %F or %T escapes in an mda option could open a security
hole, because they pass text manipulable by an attacker to a shell
command.  Potential shell characters are replaced by &#146;_&#146; before
execution.  The hole is further reduced by the fact that fetchmail
temporarily discards any suid privileges it may have while running the
MDA.  For maximum safety, however, don&#146;t use an mda command containing
%F or %T when fetchmail is run from the root account itself.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Fetchmail&#146;s method of sending bounces due to errors or spam-blocking and
spam bounces requires that port 25 of localhost be available for sending
mail via SMTP.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
If you modify <I>~/.fetchmailrc</I> while a background instance is
running and break the syntax, the background instance will die silently.
Unfortunately, it can&#146;t die noisily because we don&#146;t yet know whether
syslog should be enabled.  On some systems, fetchmail dies quietly even
if there is no syntax error; this seems to have something to do with
buggy terminal ioctl code in the kernel.
<!-- .PP -->

The -f~- option (reading a configuration from stdin) is incompatible
