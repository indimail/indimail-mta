.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B pam-checkpwd
uses PAM to authenticate the remote user with
.I checkpassword
protocol.

.PP
.IR checkpassword -style
programs are usually run by network server programs that wish to
authenticate remote user.

.PP
.B pam-checkpwd
uses PAM service name specified by
.B PAM_SERVICE
environment variable, or by the -\fBs\fR " or " --\fBservice\fR command-line option.
.B pam-checkpwd
can use an identifier specified by the -\fBi\fR " or " --\fBidentifier\fR command-line option.
You can use -i imap to use imap as an identifier when authenticating for an IMAP service. Similarly
you can use -i pop3 to use pop3 as an identifier when authenticationg for a POP3 service.

.PP
After successful authentication, if -\fBe\fR or --\fBnoenv\fR or option is not specified,
\fBpam-checkpwd\fR sets up supplementary groups of authenticated user,
its gid, its uid, and its working directory (those values are taken from the system
user database).

.PP
Normally,
.B pam-checkpwd
switches to user home directory.   If
-\fBH\fR or --\fBno\fR-\fBchdir\fR-\fBhome\fR option is specified, this step is skipped.
This option is useful when you have automounted home directories, but mail is delivered to a
central location.

.PP
If authentication fails,
.B pam-checkpwd
executes and passes input on file descriptor 3 to checkpassword compatabile program
.I prog
with
.I args
as its arguments.

If the environment variable POSTAUTH is defined as set as a path to an executable/script, the program
gets called with the authenticated username as the argument

.PP
\fB--\fR is used as usual to separate the \fBpam-checkpwd\fR own options from
\fIprog\fR options.

.PP
\fBpam-checkpwd\fR logs authentication failures (or all actions, if
--\fBdebug\fR option is used) to stderr.

.PP
Before invoking \fIprog\fR, \fBpam-checkpwd\fR sets environment variables
.BR USER ", " HOME ", and " SHELL
to appropriate values.  If --\fBnoenv\fR option is specified, this step is
skipped and the variables are left alone. This is needed when you have
virtual users which are not listed in your \fI/etc/passwd\fR,
and you need to only do authentication. Setting up process
environment is handled by some other application like \fBsetuidgid\fR.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"

.TP
.B PAM_SERVICE
.B pam-checkpwd
uses contents of
.B PAM_SERVICE
environment variable to specify the PAM service name.  This could be
overriden by -\fBs\fR option, see above.

.TP
.B POSTAUTH
If this is set to a path to an executable or script, \fBpam-checkpwd\fR will execute this program
with the authenticated username as an argument exit with the return status of the program.


.SH "DEBUGGING"
.PP
You can turn on debugging using the --\fBdebug\fR option. \fBpam-checkpwd\fR
starts to log all of its actions and the results of those actions to to stderr.

There is a way to manually trace how the \fBpam-checkpwd\fR
authenticates: use the shell redirection option. In this case
\fBpam-checkpwd\fR reads \fIcheckpassword\fR protocol data from stdin,
and logs actions to stderr. You can trace the authentication for the given user
and password with the following command-line

.PP
# printf "%s\\0%s\\0%s\\0" username password timestamp \\
.br
  | pam-checkpwd -s SERVICE -d -- /usr/bin/id 3<&0

(here timestamp could be the output of date '+%s' command)
.PP
It will trace the PAM authentication process for the user
\fIusername\fR with password \fIpassword\fR, and run the \fBid\fR
program, which will report the user and groups \fBpam-checkpwd\fR
switched to.
