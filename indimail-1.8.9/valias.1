.SH SYNOPSYS
\fBvalias\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIalias\fR | \fIaddress\fR | \fIdomain_name\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBvalias\fR adds valias entries for virtual users in the table valias. valias entries are
equivalent to .qmail files. valias is useful in cases where large number of forwarding/aliases
are to be maintained and having numerous physical files on the file system could prove to be
cumbersome/inefficient or impossible (i.e. > 32768 on some filesystems).
