Like any other piece of software (and information generally), ezmlm-idx
comes with NO WARRANTY.

This software originated from ezmlm-0.53, written by Dan J. Bernstein,
which has now been placed into the public domain.

ezmlm provided basic message distribution, subscriber address handling,
message archiving (single quoted message retrieval only), and bounce
handling. ezmlm-idx adds multi-message threaded archive retrieval, digests,
remote administration, message and subscription moderation, subscriber-only
restrictions, message trailer, subject prefix, subscriber name storage,
customizable setup, multi-language and MIME support and more. In addition,
improved bounce handling, case-insensitive subscriber address storage,
and support for distributed lists (main + sublist transparent to the
subscriber). Ezmlm-idx now includes optional support for MySQL or
PostgreSQL subscriber databases.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.
See UPGRADE to upgrade from a previous version of ezmlm-idx.

contribution will be acknowledged below in the next ezmlm-idx release.

The RPM will put ezmlm-cgi in the bin directory. To use it, you must manually
move it to a cgi-bin directory, set ownership and SUID (if needed), and
set up /ezmlm/ezcgirc.
