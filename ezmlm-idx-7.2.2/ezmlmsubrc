# ezmlm-make -C ezmlmsubrc dir dot local host
# Options:
#	-3 mainlist local	(required)
#	-4 mainlist host	(required) 
#	-6 sql connect info. Format: 'host:port:user:pw:db:table'
#	-A main list not archived (affects only bounce texts)
#	-I main list not indexed  (affects only bounce texts)
#	-d this sublist is for a digest list
#
# NOTE: For sublists of a digest list use the list local name for -3, _not_
# the digest list. Thus, to set up a sublist for list-digest@host, use
# -d -3 list -4 host. This is needed to make the texts refer correctly.
# Also, the "table" in the SQL connect info
# Should be root, where "root" is the table name used for the main list.
# A digest sublist is just like any other sublist, but the parent is
# list-digest, rather than list. You need separate sublists for each and they
# are independent. However, it's convenient to set them up in parallel, and
# they will not interfere with one another.
#
# NOTE: The list address is always added to the SQL connect info to restrict
# addresses to those serviced by this sublist.

Hi! This is the ezmlm program.
I'm managing the <#3#>@<#4#>
</#D/>
and <#3#>-digest@<#4#>
mailing lists.

</#d/>
mailing list.
</text/bounce-bottom/>

--- Enclosed is a copy of the bounce message I received.

</text/bounce-num/>

</#D/>
I've kept a list of which messages from the <#3#>@<#4#>
mailing list have bounced from your address.

</#d/>
I've kept a list of which messages from
the <#3#>-digest@<#4#>
digest list have bounced from your address. In each case, the number
is the number of the first message in the digest.

</#a/>
Copies of the messages may be in the archive.

To get message 12345 from the archive, send an empty message to:
   <<#3#>-get.12345@<#4#>>

To retrieve a set of messages 123-145 (a maximum of 100 per request),
send an empty message to:
   <<#3#>-get.123_145@<#4#>>

To receive a subject and author list for the last 100 or so messages,
send an empty message to:
   <<#3#>-index@<#4#>>

To receive the thread of messages including message 123,
send an empty message to:
   <<#3#>-thread.123@<#4#>>

<//>
Here are the message numbers:

</#D/>
Messages to you from the <#3#>@<#4#> mailing list
</#d/>
Messages to you from the <#3#>-digest@<#4#> list
<//>
seem to have been bouncing. I sent you a warning message, but it bounced.
I've attached a copy of the bounce message.

This is a probe to check whether your address is reachable. If this
probe bounces, I will remove your address from the list
without further notice. You can re-subscribe
by sending an empty message to the following address:
</#D/>
   <<#3#>-subscribe@<#4#>>

</#d/>
   <<#3#>-digest-subscribe@<#4#>>

</text/bounce-warn/>

Messages to you from the

<#3#>@<#4#> mailing list seem to
</#d/>
<#3#>-digest@<#4#> digest list seem to
<//>
have been bouncing. I've attached a copy of the first bounce
message I received.

If this message bounces too, I will send you a probe. If the probe bounces,
I will remove your address from the mailing list, without further notice.
# End of minimal sublist setup.
