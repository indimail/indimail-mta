-ezmlm-idx does not implement a full rfc822 parser. Comments can be
 inserted to defeat the MIME parsing mechanism, such as:
 Content-Type: (comment) test/plain
 This type of comment, while legal, does not occur in normal messages.
 Guiding info past ezmlm-idx MIME parsing is easier done by enclosing
 a message within a message. The mechanism isn't intended as a
 "secure" way of preventing e.g. "application/ms-tnef" from being
 disseminated.
 If you think this is a problem, E-mail ezmlm@lists.untroubled.org

-Mimeremove/reject work only at the outer MIME layer.

-ezmlm-request requires addresses to be user@host. While rfc822
 compliant, addresses like ``"the man" @ host'' are not accepted.

-ezmlm-cgi doesn't deal optimally with holes in the archive.

-ezmlm-cgi seems not to work with Chinese. The problem has been to
 find someone willing/able to participate in debugging.

-ezmlm-archive does not properly handle duplicate subjects that are not
 part of the same thread.  As a result, threads files may be written
 which span an incorrect range of months.  For example, a thread of
 subject "Linux" in 5/2005 will be carried forward in all threads files
 until 8/2013, when a new thread begins and ends with the same subject in
 8/2013.  This may affect external archive browsing tools if they assume
 every listed thread actually has messages in all the spanning months.

Some ezmlmrc are not updated and may not work right.  If you fix them,
please send them to ezmlm@lists.untroubled.org for inclusion in the next
release.
