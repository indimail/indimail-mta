Please edit the following text file and send it to this address:

<#R#>

Your mailer should have a Reply feature that uses this address automatically.

I can remove the quote marks that your mailer adds to the text,
as long as you do not edit the marker lines themselves.

The marker lines are the lines starting with '%%%'. They must not
be modified (extra characters added by your mailer at the beginning
of the line are acceptable).
