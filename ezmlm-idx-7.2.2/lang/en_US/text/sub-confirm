This confirmation serves two purposes. First, it verifies that I am able
to get mail through to you. Second, it protects you in case someone
forges a subscription request in your name.

<=q=>
Some mail programs are broken and cannot handle long addresses. If you
cannot reply to this request, instead send a message to
<<#L#>-request@<#h#>> and put the
entire address listed above into the "Subject:" line.

<=s=>
This list is moderated. Once you have sent this confirmation, the
request will be sent to the moderator(s) of this list. I will notify
you when your subscription has been activated.
