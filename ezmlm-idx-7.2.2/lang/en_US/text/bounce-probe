# Revision: 1

Messages to you from the <#l#> mailing list seem to
have been bouncing. I sent you a warning message, but it bounced.
I've attached a copy of the bounce message.

This is a probe to check whether your address is reachable. If this
probe bounces, I will remove your address from the
<#l#>@<#h#> mailing list, without further notice.

You can re-subscribe by sending a message to this address:
   <<#l#>-subscribe@<#h#>>
