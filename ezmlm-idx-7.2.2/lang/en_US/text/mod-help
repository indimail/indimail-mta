# Revision: 1
Thank you for agreeing to moderate the <#L#>@<#h#>
mailing list.

My commands are a little different from other mailing lists,
but I think you will find them intuitive and easy to use.

Here are some instructions for the tasks you may have to perform
as a list-owner and/or moderator.

General list instructions follow at the end of this message.

Remote subscription
-------------------
As a moderator, you can subscribe and unsubscribe any address to
the mailing list. To subscribe "john@example.com", simply put
a hyphen after the command word, then his address with '=' instead
of the '@'. For instance, to subscribe that address, send mail to:
   <<#L#>-subscribe-john=example.com@<#h#>>

You can similarly remove the address by sending a message to:
   <<#L#>-unsubscribe-john=example.com@<#h#>>

<=d=>
For the digest list:
   <<#L#>-digest-subscribe-john=example.com@<#h#>>
   <<#L#>-digest-unsubscribe-john=example.com@<#h#>>

<==>
That's all. No subject and no message body needed!

<=r=>
I will send you a confirmation request, to make sure
that you really sent the request. Simply reply to the
message, and your wish has been granted.
<=R=>
I will send a confirmation request to the user address, in this
case <john@example.com>. All the user has to do is to reply to
this confirmation request message.
<==>

The confirmations are necessary to make it extremely hard
for a third party to add or remove an address to the list.

I will notify the user when his/her subscriber status
has changed.

Subscription
------------

Any user can subscribe or unsubscribe by sending mail to:

    <<#L#>-subscribe@<#h#>>
    <<#L#>-unsubscribe@<#h#>>

<=d=>
For the digest list:

    <<#L#>-digest-subscribe@<#h#>>
    <<#L#>-digest-unsubscribe@<#h#>>

<==>
The user will receive a confirmation request to make
sure s/he controls the subscription address. Once this
is verified the user is unsubscribed.

<=s=>
Since this list is moderated for subscriptions, I will send a
second confirmation request to the moderator(s). Since the user
has already confirmed the desire to be on the list, you as the
moderator can be highly confident that the subscriber address is
real. If you want to approve the users request, simply reply to
my CONFIRM message. If not, you can simply delete my message or
possibly contact the potential subscriber for more information.
<=S=>
Subscriptions work the same way.
<==>

The user can also use:

   <<#L#>-subscribe-mary=example.com@<#h#>>
   <<#L#>-unsubscribe-mary=example.com@<#h#>>

to have mail sent to "mary@example.com". Only if she receives mail
at this address will she receive the confirmation request and be
able to reply to it.

Your address and identity will not be revealed to the subscriber,
unless you send mail directly to the user.

<=rl=>
To get a subscriber list for <#L#>@<#h#>, send a message to:
   <<#L#>-list@<#h#>>

To get a list transaction log <#L#>@<#h#>, send a message to:
   <<#L#>-log@<#h#>>

<=rld=>
For digest subscribers:
   <<#L#>-digest-list@<#h#>>
and:
   <<#L#>-digest-log@<#h#>>

<=rn=>
You can remotely edit the text files that make up the responses the
list sends out. To get a list of files and editing instructions, mail:
   <<#L#>-edit@<#h#>>

<=m=>
Moderated posts
---------------
When posts are moderated, I will save the posted message and send
you a copy together with instructions. The message to you will
have "MODERATE for ..." as the subject.

To accept the post, just reply to the 'Reply-To:', which I have
configured with the correct "accept" address address. You do not need
to include the post itself. In fact, I will ignore anything you send
me as long as the address you send to is correct.

If you want to reject it, send mail to the 'From:' address, which
I have configured with the correct "reject" address. This can
usually be done by 'reply-to-all', then deleting any address other
than the "reject" address. You may add a comment to the sender between
two lines starting with three '%'. I will send only this comment to the
sender with the rejected post. Again, I will not reveal your identity.

I will process the message according to the first reply I receive.
If you send me a request to accept a message that has already been
rejected or vice versa, I will let you know.

If I receive no moderator replies within a certain period of
time (normally 5 days), I will return the message to the sender
with an explanation of what happened. Your administrator can also
set up the list so that such "ignored" messages are simply deleted
without notification, rather than returned to sender.
<==>

Vacations
---------
If you are temporarily at a different address, just forward all messages
that have the correct 'Mailing-List:' header (or all that have subjects
starting with 'MODERATE for <#L#>@<#h#>'
or 'CONFIRM subscribe to <#L#>@<#h#>') to the
new address. You can then moderate from the new address. Alternatively,
you can forward the messages to a friend so that s/he can moderate
for you. Please OK this with the list owner first.

If you would like to automatically approve all requests while you
are gone, set up you mail client to auto-reply to messages that
have subjects meeting the above criteria.

<=r=>
If you try to do remote administration from an address that is not
your own, the subscriber, not you, will be asked to confirm. After
that, a moderator confirm request is sent to all moderators.
I'm doing this because I have no way of knowing that it is you that
sent the original request.

Please note that your original request (and your address) are sent to
the subscriber in this case!
<==>

Good luck!

PS: Please contact the list owner (<#L#>-owner@<#h#>) if you
have any questions or problems.
