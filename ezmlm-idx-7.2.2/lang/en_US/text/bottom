# Revision: 1

--- Administrative commands for the <#l#> list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

For help and a description of available commands, send a message to:
   <<#L#>-help@<#h#>>

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <<#L#>-subscribe@<#h#>>

To remove your address from the list, just send a message to
the address in the ``List-Unsubscribe'' header of any list
message. If you haven't changed addresses since subscribing,
you can also send a message to:
   <<#L#>-unsubscribe@<#h#>>

<=d=>
or for the digest to:
   <<#L#>-digest-unsubscribe@<#h#>>

<=HJ=>
For addition or removal of addresses, I'll send a confirmation
message to that address. When you receive it, simply reply to it
to complete the transaction.

<==>
If you need to get in touch with the human owner of this list,
please send a message to:

    <<#L#>-owner@<#h#>>

Please include a FORWARDED list message with ALL HEADERS intact
to make it easier to help you.

--- Enclosed is a copy of the request I received.
