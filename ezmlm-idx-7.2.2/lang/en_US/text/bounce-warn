# Revision: 1

Messages to you from the <#l#> mailing list seem to
have been bouncing. I've attached a copy of the first bounce
message I received.

If this message bounces too, I will send you a probe. If the probe bounces,
I will remove your address from the <#l#> mailing list,
without further notice.
