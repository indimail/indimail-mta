## Authentication modules which attempt to validate userid/password
## combinations.  See authpam(8) for more information.  The default set
## is installed at configuration time.  You may have to edit the following
## to remove unnecessary authentication modules.  In particular, if
## authpam is included in the list below, you will have to remove authpwd
## and authshadow, since their functionality is included in the authpam
## module.

##NAME: DEBUG_LOGIN:0
#
# Dump additional login diagnostics to syslog
#
# DEBUG_LOGIN=0   - turn off login debugging
# DEBUG_LOGIN=1   - turn on login debugging
# DEBUG_LOGIN=2   - turn on login debugging + log passwords too

# To advertise the SASL capability, per RFC 2449, uncomment the POP3AUTH

# POP3AUTH="LOGIN CRAM-MD5 CRAM-SHA1"

##NAME: PORT:1
#
# Port to listen on for connections.  The default is port 110.
#
#  Multiple port numbers can be separated by commas.  When multiple port
#  numbers are used it is possibly to select a specific IP address for a
#  given port as "ip.port".  For example, "127.0.0.1.900,192.68.0.1.900"
#  accepts connections on port 900 on IP addresses 127.0.0.1 and 192.68.0.1
#  The ADDRESS setting is a default for ports that do not have a specified
#  IP address.

PORT=110

##NAME: ADDRESS:0
#
# IP address to listen on.  0 means all IP addresses.

##NAME: POP3DSTART:0
#
# POP3DSTART is not referenced anywhere in the standard Courier programs
# or scripts.  Rather, this is a convenient flag to be read by your system
# startup script in /etc/rc.d, like this:
#
#  . @sysconfdir@/pop3d
#  case x$POP3DSTART in
#  x[yY]*)
#        @libexecdir@/pop3d.rc start
#        ;;
#  esac
#
# The default setting is going to be NO, until Courier is shipped by default
# with enough platforms so that people get annoyed with having to flip it to
# YES every time.

POP3DSTART=NO

##NAME: MAILDIRPATH:0
#
# MAILDIRPATH - directory name of the maildir directory.
