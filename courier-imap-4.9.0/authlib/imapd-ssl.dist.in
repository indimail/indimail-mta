#
#  This configuration file sets various options for the Courier-IMAP server
#  when used to handle SSL IMAP connections.
#
#  SSL and non-SSL connections are handled by a dedicated instance of the
#  couriertcpd daemon.  If you are accepting both SSL and non-SSL IMAP
#  connections, you will start two instances of couriertcpd, one on the
#  IMAP port 143, and another one on the IMAP-SSL port 993.

#
##NAME: SSLPORT:1
#
#  Options in the imapd-ssl configuration file AUGMENT the options in the
#  imapd configuration file.  First the imapd configuration file is read,
#  then the imapd-ssl configuration file, so we do not have to redefine
#  anything.
#
#  However, some things do have to be redefined.  The port number is
#  specified by SSLPORT, instead of PORT.  The default port is port 993.
#
#  Multiple port numbers can be separated by commas.  When multiple port
#  numbers are used it is possibly to select a specific IP address for a
#  given port as "ip.port".  For example, "127.0.0.1.900,192.68.0.1.900"
#  accepts connections on port 900 on IP addresses 127.0.0.1 and 192.68.0.1
#  The SSLADDRESS setting is a default for ports that do not have
#  a specified IP address.

SSLPORT=993

##NAME: SSLADDRESS:0
#
#  Address to listen on, can be set to a single IP address.
#
# SSLADDRESS=127.0.0.1

SSLADDRESS=0

##NAME: SSLPIDFILE:0
#
# That's the SSL IMAP port we'll listen on.
# Feel free to redefine MAXDAEMONS, TCPDOPTS, and MAXPERIP.

SSLPIDFILE=@piddir@/imapd-ssl.pid

##NAME: IMAPDSSLSTART:0
#
# Different pid files, so that both instances of couriertcpd can coexist
# happily.
#
# You can also redefine AUTHMODULES and IMAP_CAPABILITY, although I can't
# think of why you'd want to do that.
#
#
# Ok, the following settings are new to imapd-ssl:
#
#  Whether or not to start IMAP over SSL on simap port:

IMAPDSSLSTART=NO

##NAME: IMAPDSTARTTLS:0
#
#  Whether or not to implement IMAP STARTTLS extension instead:

IMAPDSTARTTLS=YES

##NAME: IMAP_TLS_REQUIRED:1
#
# Set IMAP_TLS_REQUIRED to 1 if you REQUIRE STARTTLS for everyone.
# (this option advertises the LOGINDISABLED IMAP capability, until STARTTLS
# is issued).

IMAP_TLS_REQUIRED=0


#########################################################################
#
# The following variables configure IMAP over SSL.  If OpenSSL is available
# during configuration, the couriertls helper gets compiled, and upon
# installation a dummy TLS_CERTFILE gets generated.  courieresmtpd will
# automatically advertise the ESMTP STARTTLS extension if both TLS_CERTFILE
# and COURIERTLS exist.
#
# WARNING: Peer certificate verification has NOT yet been tested.  Proceed
# at your own risk.  Only the basic SSL/TLS functionality is known to be
# working. Keep this in mind as you play with the following variables.
#
##NAME: COURIERTLS:0
#

COURIERTLS=@bindir@/couriertls

##NAME: TLS_PROTOCOL:0
# 
# TLS_PROTOCOL sets the protocol version.  The possible versions are:
#
# SSL2 - SSLv2
# SSL3 - SSLv3
# TLS1 - TLS1

TLS_PROTOCOL=SSL3

##NAME: TLS_STARTTLS_PROTOCOL:0
# 
# TLS_STARTTLS_PROTOCOL is used instead of TLS_PROTOCOL for the IMAP STARTTLS
# extension, as opposed to IMAP over SSL on port 993.
#

TLS_STARTTLS_PROTOCOL=TLS1

##NAME: TLS_CIPHER_LIST:0
#
# TLS_CIPHER_LIST optionally sets the list of ciphers to be used by the
# OpenSSL library.  In most situations you can leave TLS_CIPHER_LIST
# undefined
#
# TLS_CIPHER_LIST="ALL:!ADH:RC4+RSA:+SSLv2:@STRENGTH"

##NAME: TLS_TIMEOUT:0
# TLS_TIMEOUT is currently not implemented, and reserved for future use.
# This is supposed to be an inactivity timeout, but its not yet implemented.
#

##NAME: TLS_DHCERTFILE:0
#
# TLS_DHCERTFILE - PEM file that stores our Diffie-Hellman cipher pair.
# When OpenSSL is compiled to use Diffie-Hellman ciphers instead of RSA
# you must generate a DH pair that will be used.  In most situations the
# DH pair is to be treated as confidential, and the file specified by
# TLS_DHCERTFILE must not be world-readable.
#
# TLS_DHCERTFILE=

##NAME: TLS_CERTFILE:0
#
# TLS_CERTFILE - certificate to use.  TLS_CERTFILE is required for SSL/TLS
# servers, and is optional for SSL/TLS clients.  TLS_CERTFILE is usually
# treated as confidential, and must not be world-readable.
#
TLS_CERTFILE=@datadir@/imapd.pem

##NAME: TLS_TRUSTCERTS:0
#
# TLS_TRUSTCERTS=pathname - load trusted certificates from pathname.
# pathname can be a file or a directory. If a file, the file should
# contain a list of trusted certificates, in PEM format. If a
# directory, the directory should contain the trusted certificates,
# in PEM format, one per file and hashed using OpenSSL's c_rehash
# script. TLS_TRUSTCERTS is used by SSL/TLS clients (by specifying
# the -domain option) and by SSL/TLS servers (TLS_VERIFYPEER is set
# to PEER or REQUIREPEER).
#
#
# TLS_TRUSTCERTS=

##NAME: TLS_VERIFYPEER:0
#
# TLS_VERIFYPEER - how to verify client certificates.  The possible values of
# this setting are:
#
# NONE - do not verify anything
#
# PEER - verify the client certificate, if one's presented
#
# REQUIREPEER - require a client certificate, fail if one's not presented
#
#
TLS_VERIFYPEER=NONE

##NAME: TLS_CACHE:0
#
# A TLS/SSL session cache may slightly improve response for IMAP clients
# that open multiple SSL sessions to the server.  TLS_CACHEFILE will be
# automatically created, TLS_CACHESIZE bytes long, and used as a cache
# buffer.
#
# This is an experimental feature and should be disabled if it causes
# problems with SSL clients.  Disable SSL caching by commenting out the
# following settings:

TLS_CACHEFILE=@localstatedir@/couriersslcache
TLS_CACHESIZE=524288

##NAME: MAILDIRPATH:0
#
# MAILDIRPATH - directory name of the maildir directory.
#
MAILDIRPATH=Maildir
