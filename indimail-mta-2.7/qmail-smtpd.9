.SH NAME
qmail-smtpd \- receive mail via SMTP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-smtpd
[
.I hostname
.I checkprogram
.I subprogram
.I subprogram
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qmail-smtpd
receives mail messages via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
and invokes
.B qmail-queue
or
.B qmail-multi
(if QMAILQUEUE environment variables is defined as PREFIX/sbin/qmail-multi)
to deposit them into the outgoing queue.
.B qmail-smtpd
must be supplied several environment variables;
see
.BR tcp-environ(5) .
One important environment variable is \fBTCPREMOTEIP\fR which is the IP address of the connecting
remote host.

If the environment variable \fBTCPPARANOID\fR is set (\fBtcpserver(1)\fR with -p option),
\fBqmail-smtpd\fR returns a permanent error code 553 to the client. TCPPARANOID is set
by \fBtcpserver(1)\fR if the IP for reverse DNS address for \fBTCPREMOTEIP\fR does not
match \fBTCPREMOTEIP\fR.

.B qmail-smtpd
employs DNS look-up for the "MAIL from:" sender address. This can be bypassed using
the \fInodnscheck\fR control file.

If the environment variable \fBREQPTR\fR is set and \fBTCPREMOTEHOST\fR is absent, \fBqmail-smtpd\fR
rejects connections from unresolvable IP address (hosts without reverse DNS). \fBqmail-smtpd\fR
returns permanent error code 553 to the client. \fBTCPREMOTEHOST\fR environment variable is
removed by \fBtcpserver(1)\fR if remote host (TCPREMOTEIP) does not have a reverse DNS record.

If the environment variable
.B SMTPS
is non-empty,
.B qmail-smtpd
starts a TLS session (to support the deprecated SMTPS protocol,
normally on port 465). Otherwise, if you set the \fBSTARTTLS\fR environment variable,
.B qmail-smtpd
offers the STARTTLS extension to ESMTP.

If the environment variable \fBLOGFILTER\fR is defined, \fBqmail-smtpd\fR will open a fifo 
defined by \fBLOGFILTER\fR environment variable in O_WRONLY mode. It will write
the SMTP transaction log to the fifo. This makes it possible for \fBqmail-smtpd\fR to push
the SMTP transaction log to exernal programs. Additionally, if \fBQMAILQUEUE\fR or
\fBFILTERARGS\fR env variabels are defined, \fBqmail-smtpd\fR will make
available file descriptor 255 to be available for writing by external programs. Additionally,
\fBqmail-smtpd\fR will read 255 bytes on file descriptor 255. To use a file descriptor other than
255, use the LOGFD environment variable.  The bytes read will be logged
to stderr along with the transaction log. This makes it possible for programs called during
the data phase of SMTP to send back 255 bytes of messages back to \fBqmail-smtpd\fR. In fact,
this is used to obtain the \fBX-Bogosity\fR header from \fBbogofilter(1)\fR when during spam
filtering. An example of a SMTP transaction log is as below
.PP
.EX
qmail-smtpd: pid 14544 from ::ffff:127.0.0.1 HELO <indimail.org> \\
 MAIL from <newsletter_xxx@example.com> \\
 RCPT <mailstore@indimail.org> AUTH <local-rcpt> Size: 245988 \\
 X-Bogosity: No, spamicity=0.578967, cutoff=9.90e-01, ham_cutoff=0.00e+00, \\
 queueID=x18cs40485wff, msgID=<Newsletter_xxx@example.com>, \\
 ipaddr=217.73.48.143
.EE

.B qmail-smtpd
is responsible for counting hops.
It rejects any message with 100 or more 
.B Received
or
.B Delivered-To
header fields. The default value of 100 hops can be changed by having a control file
.IR maxhops .

.B qmail-smtpd
supports ESMTP, including the 8BITMIME, DATA, PIPELINING, SIZE, ETRN, ODMR and AUTH options.

.B qmail-smtpd
includes a \'MAIL FROM:\' parameter parser and obeys \'Auth\' and \'Size\' advertisements.

.B qmail-smtpd
can accept LOGIN, PLAIN, CRAM-MD5, CRAM-SHA1, CRAM-SHA256, CRAM-RIPEMD, DIGEST-MD5 AUTH types
(See rfc-1321(5)).  It invokes
.IR checkprogram ,
which reads on file descriptor 3 the username, a 0 byte, the password
or challenge derived from
.IR hostname ,
another 0 byte, a CRAM-MD5/CRAM-SHA1/CRAM-SHA256/CRAM-RIPEMD/DIGEST-MD5 response (if applicable to the AUTH type),
and a final 0 byte.
.I checkprogram
invokes
.I subprogram
upon unsuccessful authentication, passing the same data (read earlier on descriptor 3) on a pipe with file descriptor 4
as the write end and file descriptor 3 as the read end.
.I subprogram
should read file descriptor 3 and should in turn return 0 to
.BR qmail-smtpd ,
effectively setting the environment variables TCPREMOTEINFO and AUTHINFO
(any supplied value replaced with the authenticated username). One can specifically disable the AUTH
methods by setting DISABLE_AUTH_LOGIN, DISABLE_AUTH_PLAIN, DISABLE_CRAM_MD5, DISABLE_CRAM_SHA1,
DISABLE_CRAM_SHA256, DISABLE_CRAM_SHA512, DISABLE_CRAM_RIPEMD, DISABLE_DIGEST_MD5 environment variable. If you set
the environment variable \fBSECURE_AUTH\fR, AUTH LOGIN and AUTH PLAIN gets disabled unless STARTTLS is issued or you
run qmail-smtpd under SSL (port 465).

Once a user has authenticated or authentication is enforced MASQUERADE env variable can be used to enforce
a certain behaviour.

If the environment variable MASQUERADE is set,
.LP
.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 2
after successful authentication, relaying to outside domains will be allowed with
any sender address (if MASQUERADE is set but empty).
.IP \n+[step]
after successful authentication, relaying to outside domains will be allowed with
the sender address equal to the value of MASQUERADE environment variable
.IP \n+[step]
mails to local domain will be allowed without authentication
.LP
If the variable is not set,
.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 2
relaying will be allowed only if the IMAP/POP3 authenticated userid matches
the "MAIL from:" sender address.
.IP \n+[step]
mails to local domains will be allowed only via authenticated SMTP or if user
has authenticated via IMAP/POP3
.LP

.B qmail-smtpd
will reject the authentication attempt if it receives a nonzero return
value from
.I checkprogram
or
.IR subprogram .
There can be multiple
.I subprograms
for a particular type of authentication. The last
.I subprogram
should typically be /bin/false or /usr/bin/false depending on your Operating System.
.B qmail-smtpd
advertizes AUTH capability only if
.IR hostname
and
.IR checkprogram
are passed as the minimum arguments.

For additional security, you may set \fBFORCE_TLS\fR environment variable, for authentication
to be denied, if the client does not provide the STARTTLS command.

\fBqmail-smtpd\fR prevents unauthorized relaying and also reject mails addressed to invalid
mailboxes. To do this, \fBqmail-smtpd\fR employs the following additional checks -

.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 2
.B Check Relay Status
by looking up in \fBMySQL\fR, email addresses logged in the relay table within
past 30 Minutes, corresponding to the remote ip address of the client. This
effectively prevents the user to give any "RCPT TO:" recipient address other
than those belonging to local domains in \fIrcpthosts\fi, \fIlocals\fR control
files.  This option is turned on by defining the environment variable
\fBCHECKRELAY\fR.  Email address and IP address is logged into the relay table
when the user does a IMAP or POP3 access. This mechanism 'pop before smtp'
allows \fBqmail-smtpd\fR to relay out mails after a successful IMAP/POP3
authentication.

NOTE: Only domains not listed in \fIrcpthosts\fR are checked. Users can send emails
domains in \fIrcpthosts\fR without authentication. Authentication can be forced
for everyone by having the \fBAUTH_ALL\fR environment variable. If you desire
forced authentication for certain domains, you can do it so by having the domain
listed in the control file \fIauthdomains\fR.  In such cases of enforced
authentication, an email transaction will succeed only if the sender has
authenticated using SMTP AUTH, IMAP or POP3.  If the environment variable
\fBREQUIREAUTH\fR is set, qmail-smtpd will not accept any \fBMAIL FROM\fR
commands until and unless the client has authenticated using the \fBAUTH\fR
command. If the environment variable \fBANTISPOOFING\fR set set, qmail-smtpd
will force local users to authenticate (using AUTH, IMAP or POP3) before
accepting mails.

.IP \n+[step]
.B Check Recipient Status
by looking up in \fBMySQL\fR, status of recipients is determined before accepting the mails.
This option is turned on by defining the environment variable \fBCHECKRECIPIENT\fR to one of
the following values
 1. Reject if recipient not in MySQL
 2. Reject if recipient not in both MySQL and recipients.cdb (See below)
 3. Reject if recipient not in recipients.cdb (See below)

.IP \[bu] 2
.I Inactive Recipients
Recipients who have not logged on to the mailing system for more than 60 days
(works only if CHECKRECIPIENT is set to 1)
.IP \[bu]
.I Invalid Recipients
Recipients who do not have any accounts on the mailing system
.IP \[bu]
.I Overquota Recipients 
Recipients who have exhausted their current mailbox quota.
(works only if CHECKRECIPIENT is set to 1)

If the status of the recipient fall into any of the above category, the mail is
rejected with a permanent error.

NOTE: To turn on recipient status check for selected domains, include the domains
in the control file
.IR chkrcptdomains .
Check the \fBCONTROL FILES\fR section below for the syntax for
\fIchkrcptdomains\fR control file.

If the control file \fIchkrcptdomains\fR is absent, the  recipient status
check is turned on for all domains. If the environment variable
\fBMAX_RCPT_ERRCOUNT\fR is set, \fBqmail-smtpd\fR will reject mails if number
of errors while doing recipient status Check equals/exceeds the value defined
by \fBBR MAX_RCPT_ERRCOUNT\fR.

.IP \n+[step]
.B Check Sender Status
by looking up in the \fBMySQL\fR, status of the sender is determined before accepting the mails.
For local senders, mail is accepted only if the recipient is an active user and does not have the
NO_SMTP flag set for the user. If the CUGMAIL environment variable is defined, mails will be
accepted only from local domains (defined in rcpthosts).

.SH Database Connections
\fBqmail-smtpd\fR uses \fBinlookup(8)\fR, instead of directly connecting to
MySQL. This allows very a high queries per seconds to be achieved by avoiding
frequent tearing down of TCP/IP connections.

For a non-distributed architecture, you need a local MySQL database. To connect to a MySQL
database, you need to have a control file \fBhost\.mysql\fR. This control file contains the
IP address/hostname of the MySQL database corresponding to the \fBlocal database\fR. If
the control file \fBhost\.mysql\fR is missing, programs will use \fIlocalhost\fR to connect
to MySQL. One can also use \fIhost:user:password:socket/port[:ssl]\fR format for \fBhost.mysql\fR.

\fBinlookup\fR can be used to serve queries for multiple databases (as in a distributed architecture).
The information of all databases that \fBinlookup\fR needs to connect to can maintained in the
file \fBmcdinfo\fR. Without this file, \fBinlookup\fR will use the \fIhost.mysql\fR control file.

The information of all the databases that
.B qmail-smtpd
can connect to connect to can be maintained in the file
.BR mcdinfo .
You can use
.B dbinfo(1)
program to edit
.BR mcdinfo .
For each database that
.B qmail-smtpd
needs to connect to, the following lines need to be maintained

 domain   indimail.org 1
 server   localhost
 mdahost  192.9.0.1
 port     3306
 database vpopmail
 user     vpopmail
 pass     passwd

.B domain
has two arguments, the first is the domain name and the second if non-zero
specifies a clustered domain
.LP
.B server
specifies the server to which connection for database needs to be made to.
.LP
.B mdahost
specifies where the mails for this domain needs to be delivered to.
.LP
.B port
specifies the port on which the database server listens.
.LP
.B database
specifies the name of the database containing the mail users information.
.LP
.B user
specifies the database user having privilege to connect and carry out various activity in the mail database.
.LP
.B pass
specifies the password of the database user

.SH ETRN, AUTOTURN, ODMR
.B qmail-smtpd
supports ETRN, AUTOTURN (RFC 1985) and ODMR (RFC 2645). The parameter to an ETRN request is normally a domain name.
.B qmail-smtpd
issues a new connection when a client issues ETRN command and uses the best MX for the domain, thus avoiding security 
problems.

For AUTOTURN, no client support is required. A connect to port 25 will cause
.B qmail-smtpd
to connect back to $TCPREMOTEIP on port 25.  For enabling AUTOTURN, the following entry should be present in 
.B virtualdomains.

virt.dom:autoturn-202.144.44.3

and the following entry in the assign file

+autoturn-:indimail:508:508:/var/qmail/autoturn:-::

The above specifies that AUTOTURN be enabled for domain virt.dom. Clients only from the IP Address 202.144.44.3
can then issue the AUTOTURN command. All mails for virt.dom will be queued in the Maildir
/var/qmail/autoturn/202.144.44.3

With the spread of low-cost computer systems and Internet connectivity, the demand for local mail servers has been rising.
Many people now want to operate a mail server on a system which has only an intermittent connection to a service provider.
If the system has a static IP address, the ESMTP ETRN command [ETRN] can be used.
However, systems with dynamic IP addresses (which are very common with low-cost connections) have no widely-deployed solution.

The On-Demand Mail Relay (ODMR), which is a profile of SMTP [SMTP, ESMTP], provides a secure,
extensible, easy to implement approach to the problem.  For ODMR, access is granted to domains for a user (specified by an
email address). This is done through the
.B vatrn
command. The client has to use CRAM-MD5 authentication. To setup ODMR, setup
.B qmail-smtpd
on port 366 without any delivery queue. ODMR uses
.B maildirserial(1)
and 
.B serialsmtp(1)
to act as an SMTP client.

ETRN/AUTOTURN/ODMR command is enabled only for domains listed in the control file
.B etrnhosts
.

.B NOTE:
User Status Check does not work on ETRN/AUTOTURN/ODMR domains. Hence to turn on User Status Check for selected
domains, include non ETRN/AUTOTURN/ODMR domains in the control file
.IR chkrcptdomains .
If the control file 
.I chkrcptdomains
is absent and User Status Check is enabled, the  User Status Check is turned on for all domains. In this case mails to
ETRN/AUTOTURN/ODMR domains will bounce.

.SH TRANSPARENCY
.B qmail-smtpd
converts the SMTP newline convention into the UNIX newline convention
by converting CR LF into LF. It also accepts connections on bare LFs even though such messages violate the
SMTP protocol. Strangely some Windows MUAs do it (which is strange since CR LF is the natural Windows way of doing
things). But what else can you expect from an Organization famous for stealing things. Also if sendmail is
mis-configured it can cause this.

.B qmail-smtpd
accepts messages that contain long lines or non-ASCII characters,
even though such messages violate the SMTP protocol.

.SH "CONTROL FILES"
.B qmail-smtpd
by default looks at @controldir@ for all control files. This path can be changed by defining the CONTROLDIR
environment variable. Some of these control files can also be in cdb format if they have the
.I .cdb
extension.
Some of these control files can be in MySQL if they have the
.I .sql
extension. If you desire that the control file to be in MySQL, the file (with 
.I .sql
extension) should have an entry in the following format

.BR dbase_server_ip:dbase_user:dbase_password:dbase_name:table_name .
See qmail-control(5) to see the full list of control files which support .cdb and .sql extensions

.TP 5
.I authdomains
Any sender domain listed in this file will require authentication to be able
to send mails to any domain (local or remote). Having a domain in this
control file turns on anti-spoofing feature for the domain where the user
cannot forge the MAIL FROM address. If the MASQUERADE option is set, the
user will be able to use any MAIL FROM, but since
.B qmail-smtpd
logs all transactions, the actual user id used for authentication will be
logged.
A line in
.I authdomains
may be of the form
.BR @\fIhost ,
meaning every address at
.IR host .
.I authdomains
can also be in cdb format. if \fIauthdomains\fR.\fIcdb\fR file is present, it will be searched first.
\fIauthdomains\fR.\fIcdb\fR can be built using \fBqmail\fR-\fBcdb\fR(8).  The filename can be overriden
by the environment variable
.BR BADHOST .
You can set QREGEX environment variable if you want to use regex patterns for addresses in \fIauthdomains\fR.

.TP 5
.I badhelo
Unacceptable HELO/EHLO greeting strings.
.B qmail-smtpd
will reject every connection attempt 
if the client MTA's HELO/EHLO greeting compares with 
a REGEX pattern provided in
.IR badhelo .
To enable badhelo check, define the environment variable BADHELOCHECK or set the environment variable
BADHELO to a control file containing unacceptable HELO/EHLO greetings strings. When badhelocheck is enabled,
.B qmail-smtpd
will reject email send using HELO hostname equal to your IP address, your hostname or any hostname without dots.
if ENFORCE_FQDN_HELO is set
.B qmail-smtpd
will reject emails from hosts which pass HELO hostname without dots.
A line in
.I badhelo
may be of the form
.BR @\fIhost ,
meaning every address at
.IR host .
.I badhelo
can also be in cdb format. if \fIbadhelo\fR.\fIcdb\fR file is present, it will be searched first.
\fIbadhelo\fR.\fIcdb\fR can be built using \fBqmail\fR-\fBcdb\fR(8).  The filename can be overriden
by the environment variable
.BR BADHELO .
You can set QREGEX environment variable if you want to use regex patterns for addresses in \fIbadhelo\fR.

.TP 5
.I badip
Unacceptable IP address in environment variable
.BR TCPREMOTEIP .
.B qmail-smtpd
will reject with a temporary error code, every host listed in
.IR badip .
A line in
.I badip
may be case insensitive regular expression. To enable badip check, define the environment
variable BADIPCHECK or set the environment variable \fBBADIP\fR to a control file containing
unacceptable IP addresses.
.I badip
can also be in cdb format. if \fIbadip\fR.\fIcdb\fR file is present, it will be searched first.
\fIbadip\fR.\fIcdb\fR can be built using \fBqmail\fR-\fBcdb\fR(8).  The filename can be overriden
by the environment variable
.BR BADIP .
You can set QREGEX environment variable if you want to use regex patterns for addresses in \fIbadip\fR.

.TP 5
.I badhost
Unacceptable remote host in environment variable
.BR TCPREMOTEHOST .
.B qmail-smtpd
will reject every host listed in
.IR badhost .
A line in
.I badhost
may be a case insensitive regular expression.
To enable badhost check, define the environment variable BADHOSTCHECK or set the environment variable
BADHOST to a control file containing unacceptable remote hosts.

.TP 5
.I accesslist
.B qmail-smtpd
will apply access list to allow email transaction between
sender and recipient. A line in
.I accesslist
is of the form

 type:sender:recipient

where type is either the word 'from' or 'rcpt' and \fIsender\fR and
\fIrecipient\fR can be the actual sender, recipient or a wildcard. The environment
variable QREGEX can be set to match \fIsender\fR, \fIrecipient\fR using
regular expressions.

.EX
 rcpt:ceo@indimail.org:country_distribution_list@indimail.org
 rcpt:md@indimail.org:country_distribution_list@indimail.org
 from:recruiter@yahoo.com:hr@indimail.org 

 - only ceo@indimail.org and md@indimail.org
   are permitted to send mails to country_distribution_list@indimail.org
 - recruiter@yahoo.com is permitted to send mails to
   hr@indimail.org only

These restrictions do not apply when the from is "" or the recipient is
postmaster or abuse. This is to prevent violating RFCs. A utility
\fBuacl(1)\fR is provided to test the accesslist.
.EE

.TP 5
.I badmailfrom
Unacceptable envelope sender addresses.
.B qmail-smtpd
will reject every recipient address for a message
if the envelope sender address is listed in
.IR badmailfrom .
A line in
.I badmailfrom
may be of the form
.BR @\fIhost ,
meaning every address at
.IR host .
.I badmailfrom
can also be in cdb format. if \fIbadmailfrom\fR.\fIcdb\fR file is present, it will be searched first.
\fIbadmailfrom\fR.\fIcdb\fR can be built using \fBqmail\fR-\fBcdb\fR(8).  The filename can be overriden
by the environment variable
.BR BADMAILFROM .
You can set QREGEX environment variable if you want to use regex patterns for envelope sender addresses.

.TP 5
.I badmailpatterns
Gives 
.B qmail-smtpd 
the ability to filter E-Mails by comparing the sender  
address with a REGEX pattern in 
.IR badmailpatterns . 
Example:

  *@earthlink.net
  !fred@earthlink.net
  [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]@[0-9][0-9][0-9].com
  answerme@save*
  *%*

.I badmailpatterns
file with this contents stops all mail from Earthlink except from
fred@earthlink.net. It also stops all mail with addresses like:
12345@123.com and answerme@savetrees.com. Further, any E-Mail with       
a sender address containing a percent sign (%) is rejected.
The filename can be overriden by the environment variable
.BR BADMAILPATTERNS .
\fIbadmailpatterns\fR gets disabled of you set \fBQREGEX\fR environment variable.
\fIbadmailpatterns\fR uses simple shell-style pattern matching unlike regular
expressions used by setting \fBQREGEX\fR environment variable.
You can set regex patterns in \fIbadmailfrom\fR itself if \fBQREGEX\fR environment variable is enabled.

.TP 5
.I tlsserverciphers
A set of OpenSSL cipher strings. Multiple ciphers contained in a
string should be separated by a colon. If the environment variable
.B TLSCIPHERS
is set to such a string, it takes precedence.

.TP 5
.I tlsservermethod
The TLS protocol list. Accepted values are SSLv23, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1_1, TLSv1_2. The default is TLSv1.
This control file is used for openssl version < 1.0.1. OpenSSL Version >= 1.0.1 uses TLS_server_method() where
The actual protocol version used will be negotiated to the highest version mutually supported by the client
and the server.  The supported protocols are SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2.

.TP 5
.I tlsclients
A list of email addresses. When relay rules would reject an incoming message,
.B qmail-smtpd
can allow it if the client presents a certificate that can be verified against
the CA list in
.I clientca.pem
and the certificate email address is in
.IR tlsclients .

.TP 5
.I servercert.pem
SSL certificate to be presented to clients in TLS-encrypted sessions.
Should contain both the certificate and the private key. Certifying Authority
(CA) and intermediate certificates can be added at the end of the file. The filename
can be overriden by the environment variable \fBSERVERCERT\fR.
The default location of @controldir@ can be overriden by environment variable CERTDIR

.TP 5
.I clientca.pem
A list of Certifying Authority (CA) certificates that are used to verify
the client-presented certificates during a TLS-encrypted session. The
filename can be overriden by the environment variable \fBCLIENTCA\fR.
The default location of @controldir@ can be overriden by environment variable CERTDIR

.TP 5
.I clientcrl.pem
A list of Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). If present it
should contain the CRLs of the CAs in 
.I clientca.pem 
and client certs that will be checked for revocation. The
filename can be overriden by the environment variable \fBCLIENTCRL\fR.
The default location of @controldir@ can be overriden by environment variable CERTDIR

.TP 5
.I rsa512.pem
If this 512 bit RSA key is provided,
.B qmail-smtpd
will use it for TLS sessions instead of generating one on-the-fly.
The default location of @controldir@ can be overriden by environment variable CERTDIR

.TP 5
.I dh1024.pem
If these 1024 bit DH parameters are provided,
.B qmail-smtpd
will use them for TLS sessions instead of generating one on-the-fly 
(which is very timeconsuming).
The default location of @controldir@ can be overriden by environment variable CERTDIR

.TP 5
.I dh512.pem
512 bit counterpart for 
.B dh1024.pem. 
The default location of @controldir@ can be overriden by environment variable CERTDIR

.TP 5
.I signatures
Unacceptable base64 encoded MIME types in message.
.B qmail-smtpd
will reject every message if the first 9 significant
characters (eg.
.BR TVqQAAMAA )
of any of it's embedded MIME types is identical with one
present in
.IR signatures.
The control file
.I signatures
is evaluated if the environment variable VIRUSCHECK
is set but empty. All matches will be logged. Additionally a description for the pattern can
be set by appending it just after the pattern, with a colon \fB:\fR as a separator. i.e.

TvqQAAMAA:An Executable from a Dirty OS

By default the pattern is matched in both the headers and the body
The word -header or -body can be appended to the comment (with \fB:\fR as a separator) to run the check
only on the mail header or mail body respectively.
The word -headerblackhole or -bodyblackhole can be appended to the comment to run
the check only on the mail header or mail body respectively and also blackhole the mail. i.e.

TvqQAAMAA:An Executable from a Dirty OS:-body

The filename can be overriden by the environment variable
.BR SIGNATURES .

.TP 5
.I bodycheck
This control file gives
.B qmail-smtpd
content-filtering ability. Any regex
pattern in this file will be matched againt all lines entered in the SMTP
data session. e.g. To block files with an extension created by a widely
used brain-dead word processor used by some modern cave men

 ^Content-Disposition:.*filename=".*.doc":Prehistoric documents from M$
 ^X-QHPSI:.*Virus found: Virus email from M$

By default the pattern is matched in both the headers and the body
The word -header or -body can be appended (with colon \fB:\fR as a separator) to the comment to run bodycheck
only on the mail header or mail body respectively. The word blackhole can be
appended to -header or -body to silently discard the email in case of a match. All attemts for emails which get rejected when
they match a pattern get logged.
The bodycheck control gets enabled if the environment variable
.B BODYCHECK
is set.
The filename can be overriden by the environment variable
.B BODYCHECK
provided
that the value of
.B BODYCHECK
environment variable is non-empty.
e.g. BODYCHECK=bodycheck.paranoid

.TP 5
.I badrcptto
Unacceptable envelope recipient addresses.
.B qmail-smtpd
will reject every incoming message
if the envelope recipient address is listed in
.IR badrcptto .
This control file is complementary to
.IR badmailfrom .
A line in
.I badrcptto
may be of the form
.BR @\fIhost ,
meaning every address at
.IR host .
.I badrcptto
can also be in cdb format. if \fIbadrcptto\fR.\fIcdb\fR file is present, it will be searched first.
\fIbadrcptto\fR.\fIcdb\fR can be built using \fBqmail\fR-\fBcdb\fR(8).  The filename can be overriden
by the environment variable
.BR BADRCPTTO .
You can set QREGEX environment variable if you want to use regex patterns for addresses in \fIBADRCPTTO\fR.

.I blackholedsender
Envelope sender address causing delivery of mail to a blackhole.
.B qmail-smtpd
will carry on the SMTP connection without writing the mail to the queue
after recognizing an envelope sender address listed in
.IR blackholedsender .
The peer (Client) is notified of success. This is called blackholing where the mail is forever lost.
A line in
.I blackholedsender
may be of the form
.BR \fI@host ,
meaning every address at
.IR host .
.I blackholedsender
can also be in cdb format. If

The filename can be overriden by the environment variable
.IR BLACKHOLEDSENDER .
You can set QREGEX environment variable if you want to use regex patterns for
blackholed envelope sender addresses.

.TP 5
.I blackholedpatterns
Gives 
.B qmail-smtpd 
the ability to blackhole E-Mails by comparing the sender  
address with a REGEX pattern in

.I QREGEX

The files badhelo, badmailfrom, badrcptto, blackholedsender, spamignore,
relaymailfrom, authdomains, chkrcptdomains, goodrcptto, blackholedrcpt can be used with
regular expressions if the environment variable QREGEX is defined (in which case, the control
files badhelopatterns, badmailfrompatterns, badrcpttopatterns, blackholedpatterns,
blackholedrcptpatterns, goodrcptpatterns etc are not required and get disabled).

# drop everything containing the word spam

 .*spam.*

# force users to fully qualify themselves (ie deny "user", accept "user@domain")

.TP 5
.I maxrecipients 
maxrecipients is the number of RCPT TO:'s
.B qmail-smtpd
will accept in a SMTP session.
Default: 0 which means no restriction.
The environment variable 
.B MAXRECIPIENTS
overrides the value in this control file.

.TP 5
.I databytes
Maximum number of bytes allowed in a message,
or 0 for no limit.
Default: 0.
If a message exceeds this limit,
.B qmail-smtpd
returns a permanent error code to the client;
in contrast, if
the disk is full or
.B qmail-smtpd
hits a resource limit,
.B qmail-smtpd
returns a temporary error code. If you define the environment variable \fBDATABYTES_NOTIFY\fR,
then the recipient gets notified in case a message is bounced back to the sender due to crossing
the databyte limit.

.I databytes
counts bytes as stored on disk, not as transmitted through the network.
It does not count the
.B qmail-smtpd
Received line, the
.B qmail-queue
Received line, or the envelope.

If the environment variable
.B DATABYTES
is set, it overrides
.IR databytes .

.TP 5
.I greetdelay
The greetdelay control file adds a defined delay after the SMTP client has initiated the SMTP session and before
.B qmail-smtpd
answers with "220 ESMTP" welcome prompt. A negative value in the control file causes the session to be terminated
if any input is received before the welcome prompt. The absolute value in the control file determines the delay.

This can be helpful to trap junk SMTP traffic (well-behaved MTAs will wait for the welcome prompt before sending).
Time enough to discourage a typical Spambot's SMTP client from continuing the SMTP session (the session will be
aborted by the client). Setting of GREETDELAY does not harm 'regular' mail clients, but will reduce Spam traffic.
It has been argued, that the sleeping
.B qmail-smtpd
blocks local resources and it should be better to send
the client a 55x reply (in case of protocol violations) by having a negative value for the greet delay. However, one
should keep in mind, that not only the resources on the mail server are used, but in addition those of the spam mail
sender are blocked for that particular session. Thus, the
.B GREETDELAY
will not only save you for spam mails, but unlike Greylisting and/or filtering a la SpamAssassin, this is the only mean to really
reduce the overall amount of spam because the timeslot required for the spam sender to deliver messages (whether 
successfully or unsuccessfully) is raised from typically one second to (<=) GREETDELAY seconds.

The delay can also be set via the environment variable
.BR GREETDELAY ,
which is typically set by means of
.BR tcpserver 's
rule-set file. A value of GREETDELAY="30" will delay the qmail-smtpd's greeting for 30 seconds. A value of
GREETDELAY="-30" will delay the qmail-smtpd's greeting by 30 seconds and as well as terminate the session if
any input is received before 30 seconds.  If the environment variable
.B GREETDELAY
is set, it overrides
.I greetdelay
control file

.TP 5
.I dnsbllist
A list of dnsbl providers that \fBqmail-smtpd\fR checks to identify blacklisted ip addresses.
The filename can be overriden by the environment variable
.BR DNSBLLIST .

If the environment variable \fBSKIPDNSBL\fR is set, \fBqmail-smtpd\fR ignores
\fIdnsbllist\fR, and the dnsbl check is not performed. The check is skipped even if some
other authentication method succedeed which authorize the client to relay (smtp-auth or tls
client certificate), or if \fBRELAYCLIENT\fR enviromnent variable is set. The \fIdnsbllist\fR
functionality is provided by PREFIX/lib/indimail/plugins/smtpd-plugin0 plugin.

.TP 5
.I localiphost
Replacement host name for local IP addresses.
Default:
.IR me ,
if that is supplied.
.B qmail-smtpd
is responsible for recognizing dotted-decimal addresses for the
current host.
When it sees a recipient address of the form
.IR box@[d.d.d.d] ,
where
.I d.d.d.d
is a local IP address,
it replaces
.IR [d.d.d.d]
with
.IR localiphost .
This is done before
.IR rcpthosts .

.TP 5
.IR moreipme
.B qmail-smtpd 
will treat all addresses in this file exactly as if they were local,
though not identified initially by the OS; eg. in a NAT environment.
Local IP addresses can be displayed by means of the program
.B ipmeprint .

.TP 5
.IR notipme
.B qmail-smtpd 
will ignore detected local IP addresses included in
.IR notipme .
This has precedence over
.IR moreipme .
.LP
.IR moreipme ,
.IR notipme
can be used in some configurations that involve network
address translation or port forwarding.  It prevents a problem caused
by an MX or other mail routing directive instructing qmail to connect to
itself without realizing it's connecting to itself.  When this happens,
it accepts the message, finds out where to deliver it to (itself), and
promptly reconnects to itself to deliver the message.  Eventually, when
it has done this 20 or 30 times, it will give up and bounce the message,
but not before sucking up all of your CPU while it's happening.

It may also be useful in some configurations that have multiple qmail
servers configured on different interfaces of the same system.  qmail
will normally refuse to deliver mail by SMTP to the machine it's
running on, but with multiple copies of qmail, you may want to prevent
this behavior.

Normally, qmail can detect what IP addresses refer to itself by getting
a list of all network interfaces with IP addresses from the operating
system.  It uses this list to determine whether connecting to an address
will cause it to connect to itself, and avoid the situation (it calls
the perm_ambigmx() function, which prints the message:

   Sorry. Although I'm listed as a best-preference MX or A for
   that host, it isn't in my control/locals file, so I don't
   treat it as local. (#5.4.6)

But in situations where the OS is not aware of all IP addresses that
connect back to itself, this detection fails, causing the CPU-sucking
phenomenon described above.  This can happen if there is a network
address translation device in front of the qmail server, such as a
load-balancer or a router which allows you to share one IP address among
several machines; if there is a port forwarder forwarding connections
from some other machine to the SMTP server on the qmail server; or in
configurations where a "dumb" mailserver is configured to use your qmail
server as a "smarthost", delivering all mail to it without inspection.

To solve this, other IP addresses which will ultimately connect back to
your machine can be added to the file "control/moreipme", one per line.
qmail will treat all addresses in this file exactly as if they were
local, and if it finds an MX record or other mail routing information
which would cause it to connect to any of these addresses, it will call
perm_ambigmx(), and print the above error message.

Additionally, IP addresses which the system detects but which should
*not* be treated as local can be removed from qmail's ipme list by
adding them to the file "control/notipme".

"control/notipme" takes precedence over "control/moreipme".  In other
words, addresses that appear in both "control/moreipme" and
"control/notipme" will not be considered local.

You can run the program "ipmeprint" to see what interfaces qmail is detecting or finds in moreipme.

.TP 5
.I morercpthosts
Extra allowed RCPT domains.
If
.I rcpthosts
and
.I morercpthosts
both exist,
.I morercpthosts
is effectively appended to
.IR rcpthosts .

You must run
PREFIX/sbin/qmail-newmrh
whenever
.I morercpthosts
changes.

Rule of thumb for large sites:
Put your 50 most commonly used domains into
.IR rcpthosts ,
and the rest into
.IR morercpthosts .

.TP 5
.I nodnscheck
DNS checks are prohibited for sender addresses (Mail from:)
included here. Addresses can be expressed individually and/or
for a domain:

.EX

.EE

If the environment variable
.B NODNSCHECK
is set, 
.B qmail-smtpd
will ignore 
.IB nodnscheck
and the DNS check will be disabled in general.
A line in
.I nodnschecks
may be of the form
.BR @\fIhost ,
meaning every address at
.IR host .

.TP 5
.I rcpthosts
Allowed RCPT domains.
If
.I rcpthosts
is supplied,
.B qmail-smtpd
will reject
any envelope recipient address with a domain not listed in
.IR rcpthosts .

Exception:
If the environment variable
.B RELAYCLIENT
is set,
.B qmail-smtpd
will ignore
.IR rcpthosts ,
and will append the value of
.B RELAYCLIENT
to each incoming recipient address.

.I rcpthosts
may include wildcards:

.EX
   heaven.af.mil
   .heaven.af.mil
.EE

Envelope recipient addresses without @ signs are
always allowed through.

.TP 5
.I etrnhosts

QMAILHOME/autoturn/domain_name/Maildir where domain_name is the name of the domain.

.TP 5
.I relayclients
IP addresses of clients allowed to relay mail through this host.
Each address should be followed by a colon and an (optional) string
that should be appended to each incoming recipient address, just as
with the
.B RELAYCLIENT
environment variable.
Nearly always, the optional string should be null. The filename can be
overriden by the environment variable
.BR RELAYCLIENTS .

Addresses in
.I relayclients
may be wildcarded:

.EX
   192.168.0.1:
   192.168.1.:
.EE

.TP 5
.I relaydomains
Host and domain names allowed to relay mail through this host.
Each address should be followed by a colon and an (optional) string
that should be appended to each incoming recipient address, just as
with the
.B RELAYCLIENT
environment variable.
Nearly always, the optional string should be null.

Addresses in
.I relaydomains
may be wildcarded:

.EX
   heaven.af.mil:
   .heaven.af.mil:
.EE
 
.TP 5
.I relaymailfrom
envelope senders (MAIL FROM) listed in this file will be allowed to relay
independently of the $RELAYCLIENT environment variable. Entries in
.I relaymailfrom 
can be E-Mail addresses, or just the domain (with the @ sign). Unlike
.I relaydomains 
native addresses should be entered.
A line in
.I relaymailfrom
may be of the form
.BR @\fIhost ,
meaning every address at
.IR host .
.I relaymailfrom
can also be in cdb format. If
.I relaymailfrom.cdb
is present, it will be searched first.
Examples:

.EX

.EE

.TP 5
.I recipients
List of external resources providing acceptable,
full-qualified envelope addresses 
(\'RCPT to: <recip@domain>\')
to be used for recipient verification
during the SMTP session.

The external sources can be either
.B fastforward 
compliant cdbs including the envelope addresses, 
where the path to a cdb has to be referenced 
relative to Qmail's home directory - or -
.B checkpassword
compatible Plugable Authentication Modules
(PAM), receiving the envelope address on FD 3 
as 'recip@domain\\0\\0\\0' and returning '0'
in case of success and '1' in case of failure. 
The use of a PAM is indicated with a delimiting '|' and
it will be called with up to five additional parameters; 
while a cdb follows a ':', which can be omitted.

The list of external sources is consulted line-by-line for each
recipient envelope address until the first positive answer,  
or a final negative response is encountered.  
Which external source to be queried, depends on the domain part of the
recipient envelope address specified on the left side of the 
.I recipients 
file, while the external resource is provided right from the delimitor.

The addresses' domain part is evaluted in lower-case.
An exact domain match can be encompassed by means of a leading '@'. 
The '*' is a generic wildcard for all domains. 
Specific domains can be excluded from the lookup by means of a 
leading '!'; thus all recipient addresses are accepted for this domain.  
Additionally, a '!*' can be used as wildcard for all domains not encountered
before in 
.I recipients 
(pass-thru).

A
.I recipients
file is always constructed like 'domain:cdb','domain|pam', 
or simply 'cdb':

.EX
   !nocheck.com
   @mydomain.com:recipients.cdb
   example.com|ldap_pam ldapserver host port DN passwd
   *:etc/fastforward.cdb
   *|ldap_pam otherserver
   !*
.EE

Legacy format:

.EX
   recipients.cdb
   etc/fastforward.cdb
.EE

NOTE: Particular domains starting with a '!' or
a '@' should be placed in the beginning of the 
.I recipients
file for performance reasons, while the pass-thru
statement '!*' has to be on the last line.
The recipients check is applied after the
.I rcpthosts
evaluation.

.B recipient-cdb 
may be used to construct a 
.I ASSIGN/recipients.cdb 
from 
.IR ASSIGN/recipients .

The
.B qmail-smtpd
recipients mechanism supports Qmail's address extension (VERP).
Unqualified envelope recipients are appended with \'@localhost\'.

1 selects 'annotate-only' mode, where
.B qmail-smtpd
will annotate incoming email with
.B Received-SPF
fields, but will not reject any messages.  2 will produce temporary
failures on DNS lookup problems so you can make sure you always have
meaningful Received-SPF headers.  3 selects 'reject' mode,
where incoming mail will be rejected if the SPF record says 'fail'.  4
selects a more stricter rejection mode, which is like 'reject' mode,
except that incoming mail will also be rejected when the SPF record
says 'softfail'.  5 will also reject when the SPF record says 'neutral',
and 6 if no SPF records are available at all (or a syntax error was
encountered). The contents of this file are overridden by the value of
the

may be of the form
.BR @\fIhost ,
meaning every address at
.IR host .
.I chkrcptdomains
can also be in cdb format. if \fIchkrcptdomains\fR.\fIcdb\fR file is present, it will be searched first.
\fIchkrcptdomains\fR.\fIcdb\fR can be built using \fBqmail\fR-\fBcdb\fR(8).
You can set QREGEX environment variable if you want to use regex patterns for addresses in \fIchkrcptdomains\fR.

Default: All domains listed in rcpthosts are checked if CHECKRECIPIENT is defined and this control file is absent.
If the CUGMAIL environment variable is defined, mails will be accepted only
from local domains (defined in rcpthosts). Also the users will be required
to be active and have privileges to use SMTP.

.TP 5
.I domainqueue
Specific queue can be assigned to recipient domains. The format of this file is of the
form

domain:QUEUEDIR=queue_dir

where domain is the recipient domain and queue_dir is any queue which is part of
indimail's queue collection. You could also specify a set of queues for a domain.

domain:QUEUE_COUNT=5,QUEUE_START=6,QUEUE_BASE=/var/indimail/queue

specifies that any emails to *@domain be queued in /var/indimail/queue/queue[6,7,8,9,10]
You can use \fIdomainqueue\fR to queue mails for certain domains into specific domains and
specify individual concurrencies for these queues (see qmail-send(8)). e.g. having

yahoo.com:QUEUEDIR=/var/indimail/queue/queue6
in @controldir@/domainqueue and

10

pat:envar1=val,envar2=val,...]
where \fIpat\fR is a regular expression which matches a sender. envar1, envar2
are list of environment variables to be set. If
.I val
is omitted, the environment variable is unset.

The name of the control file can be overriden by the environment
variable
.BR FROMRULES .

Example:
  answerme@save*:DATABYTES=2000000, MAXRECIPIENT=2,QMAILQUEUE=
  :BADRCPTTO=mybadrcptto

first line sets databytes 2000000 bytes, max no of recipients in
rcptto to two for the sender answerme@saveme.com and unsets QMAILQUEUE environment variable.
If there are multiple lines for a pattern, all lines are applied. However if an environment
variable is being set in multiple lines, the last rule takes precedence. The environment
variable QREGEX can be set to use regular expressions for matching \fIpat\fR instead
of the internal \fIwildmat\fR function.
The second line gets applied for null senders

.TP 5
.I auth.envrules
Specific environment variables can be set for clients who have RELAYCLIENT set or authenticate
using SMTP AUTH. These environment variables are available for \fBqmail-queue(8)\fR.
The format of this file is of the form                                       
<>:envar1=val,envar2=val,...]
envar1, envar2 are list of environment variables to be set. If
.I val
is omitted, the environment variable is unset.

The name of the control file can be overriden by the environment
variable

.SH SMTP PLUGINS
\fBqmail-smtpd\fR has ability to load plugins from the plugins directory. This is done by
using dlopen(3) on smtpd-plugin.so. The plugin file can be changed by setting environment
variable \fBSMTP_PLUGIN\fR. After loading the plugin, the function \fIplugin_init()\fR is
executed. The function to be executed can be changed by setting environment variable
\fBSMTP_PLUGIN_SYM\fR. The function \fIplugin_init()\fR should return a PLUGIN structure (see
plugin_init(3) for details). The PLUGIN structure returns pointer to three functions to
be executed in the MAIL FROM, RCPT and DATA phase of SMTP. You can disable the loading
of plugins by setting \fBDISABLE_PLUGIN\fR environment variable

By default \fBqmail-smtpd\fR looks for plugins in PREFIX/lib/indimail/plugins directory. You can
change this by defining \fBPLUGINDIR\fR environment variable. You can also load multiple
plugins by creating smtpd-plugin0.so, smtpd-plugin1.so, and so on. You can also test
the plugins using the \fBplugtest(1)\fR command.

.SH Virtual Package Functionality
\fBqmail-smtpd\fR can load an external library to add functionality. The virtual package
can be loaded by setting the environment variable \fBVIRTUAL_PKG_LIB\fR or by using the
control file \fIlibindimail\fR. The value in \fIlibindimail\fR is set to
\fIlibindimail\fR.\fIso\fR by default.

Following functions should be provided by the shared library
parse_function(), vshow_atrn_map(), atrn_access(),
iopen(), iclose(), sql_getpw(), get_real_domain()

.SH GREYLISTING
.B qmail-smtpd
has the ability to greylist incoming mails. Subject to the environment variable
.B GREYIP
being set, greylist checks are made for incoming SMTP connections prior to accepting messages.

"Full" greylisting is implemented, meaning that the connecting IP address, envelope sender and envelope recipient form the triplet that is checked.

.B qmail-greyd
is used by qmail-smtpd to carry out these checks;
.B qmail-smtpd
communicates with qmail-greyd using UDP.
.B qmail-greyd
itself is written in Perl.
To enable greylisting the environment variable
.B GREYIP
is used. For the default values (loopback address 127.0.0.1, port 1999) use,

.EX
   GREYIP="127.0.0.1@1999"
.EE

Alternatively a different IP address and/or port can be specified as
in these examples,

.EX
   GREYIP="192.168.1.50"
   GREYIP="::1@1999"
   GREYIP="192.168.1.33@1999"
.EE

Exception:
If the environment variable
.B RELAYCLIENT
is set (see details on this above), greylisting does not occur.

Greylisting may be explicitly disabled by setting
.B GREYIP
to an empty string,

.EX
   GREYIP=""
.EE

Clearly
.B qmail-greyd
must be available to respond to greylisting queries. If the
GREYIP address/port is unavailable and the system detects
this - perhaps via an ICMP 'unreachable' type response - the
SMTP session aborts with a temporary error when the
greylisting check occurs; the errno string is logged to help
troubleshooting (typically qmail-greyd isn't running or is
blocked by firewall rules). Otherwise if there is no response
a timeout occurs, producing the same temporary error but without
further logging detail.

.SH "VIRUS SCANNING"
The environment variable VIRUSCHECK can be set to one of the 7 values given below
for scanning MS viruses which affect vulnerable Operating Systems. Virus scanning
is not handled by \fBqmail-smtpd\fR(8). It is done by \fBqmail-multi\fR(8), which
uses \fBqscanq\fR(8) to extract the attachments in a temporary work directory and
run a suitable virus scanner like \fBclamdscan\fR(1). \fBqscanq\fR(8) also handles
the check for prohibited filename extensions.

 1. Internal virus scanner (via signatures control file)
 2. Internal+External (qscanq) virus scanner
 3. Internal virus scanner and checking mime for prohibited filename
    extensions (qscanq)
 4. Internal+External(qscanq) virus scanner and checking mime for
    prohibited filename extensions
 5. External(qscanq) virus scanner and checking mime for prohibited
    filename extensions
 6. External virus scanner (via qscanq)
 7. Check for prohibited filename extensions (qscanq)
