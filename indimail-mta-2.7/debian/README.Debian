indimail-mta for Debian
-------------------

This package has been built using openSUSE build service. It has been a painful
experience to get a debian package built. Using RPM to build a binary package is
a far better and an elegant way. Hope that one day the debian developers see some
sense and make dpkg and tools to be flexible like the RPM.
