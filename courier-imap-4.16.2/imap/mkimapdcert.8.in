.SH NAME
mkimapdcert \- create a test SSL certificate for IMAP over SSL
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fB@sbindir@/mkimapdcert\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
IMAP over SSL requires a valid, signed, X.509 certificate.  The default
location for the certificate file is
\fI@datadir@/imapd.pem\fR\&.
\fBmkimapdcert\fR generates a self-signed X.509 certificate,
mainly for
testing.
For production use the X.509 certificate must be signed by a
recognized certificate authority, in order for mail clients to accept the
certificate.
.PP
\fI@datadir@/imapd.pem\fR must be owned by the
@mailuser@ user and
have no group or world permissions.
The \fBmkimapdcert\fR command will
enforce this.  To prevent an unfortunate accident,
\fBmkimapdcert\fR
will not work if \fB@datadir@/imapd.pem\fR already exists.
.PP
\fBmkimapdcert\fR requires
\fBOpenSSL\fR to be installed.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\fB@datadir@/imapd.pem\fR
X.509 certificate.
.TP
\fB@sysconfdir@/imapd.cnf\fR
Parameters used by OpenSSL to
create the X.509 certificate.
