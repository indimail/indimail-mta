SYNOPSYS
adminclient -h adminHost -p port -u adminUser -P adminPassword [-n certfile]
  -c Command
DESCRIPTION
indisrvr is the administration client for administering IndiMail's clustered domains. It has a simple mechanism by which administrators can connect to the administration server - indisrvr and issue commands to execute any of the IndiMail programs given above.  On successful validation of password, adminclient executes the specified IndiMail administration program on the remote host running indisrvr. For security reasons, the list of these administration programs are hard-coded in the adminclient and indisrvr executable. adminclient uses environment variable ADMIN_TIMEOUT to timeout connections to indisrvr.

e.g. The following command runs the command vadduser with arguments 
test@indi.com password.

adminclient -h phoenix2 -p  4000 -u admin -p adminpass -c "vadduser test@indi.com password"
