.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBvfstab\fR is a utility for maintaining the FSTAB table. The FSTAB table maintains the
filesystems which can be used for serving the user mailboxes. Normally when creating an user
account (\fBvadduser\fR), the environment variable BASE_PATH is used. This however is not optimal
when having multiple filesystems. In such case, the administrator can use the -b option in
\fBvadduser\fR to distribute the users across multiple filesystems, taking into account the
load of the different filesystems. The load factor is computed by running vfstab with -b
option periodically through cron(1).
