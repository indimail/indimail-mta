.SH SYNOPSYS
\fBadminclient\fR \fB\-h\fR \fIadminHost\fR \fB\-p\fR \fIport\fR \fB\-u\fR \fIadminUser\fR \fB\-P\fR \fIadminPassword\fR [\fB\-n\fR \fIcertfile\fR] \fB\-c\fR \fICommand\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBadminclient\fR is the administration client for administering IndiMail's clustered domains.
It has a simple mechanism by which administrators can connect to the administration server,
\fBindisrvr\fR and issue commands to execute any of the IndiMail programs \fICommand\fR.
On successful validation of password, \fBadminclient\fR executes the specified IndiMail
administration program on the remote host by connecting to \fBindisrvr(8)\fR. For security
reasons, the list of these administration programs are hard-coded in the \fBadminclient\fR
and \fBindisrvr\fR executable. \fBadminclient\Fr uses environment variable \fBADMIN_TIMEOUT\fR
to timeout connections to \fBindisrvr\fR.

.EX
 e.g. The following command runs the command vadduser with arguments 
 test@indi.com password.

 adminclient -h phoenix2 -p  4000 -u admin -p adminpass -c "vadduser test@indi.com password"
