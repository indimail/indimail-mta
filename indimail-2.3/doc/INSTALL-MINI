Installing indimail-mini
========================
A indimail-mini installation doesn't have a mail queue. Instead it gives each new
message to a central server through QMQP.

There are three standard applications of indimail-mini:

    * At a large site, mail service is centralized on a few hosts. All other hosts
      are null clients running indimail-mini. Setting up the null clients is easy; see below.
    * A firewall sends all incoming messages to an internal gateway. The firewalls run
      indimail-mini plus qmail-smtpd. There's very little code to audit, and none of it runs
      as root.
    * A computer sends mail to a huge mailing list through a better-connected smarthost. The
      computer runs indimail for its own local deliveries, but it also has ezmlm configured to
      use a separate indimail-mini installation for the mailing list. QMQP is typically 100
      times faster than SMTP here; for example, you can send a 1000-recipient message through
      a 28.8 modem in about 10 seconds. 

How do I set up a QMQP server?
=============================
Here's how to set up a central server to offer QMQP service to authorized client hosts.

IndiMail includes a QMQP server, qmail-qmqpd. You also need to have tcpserver installed.

first create /etc/indimail/etc/qmqp.tcp in tcprules format to allow queueing from the
authorized hosts. make sure to deny connections from unauthorized hosts. for example, if
queueing is allowed from 1.2.3.*:

     1.2.3.:allow
     :deny

Then create /etc/indimail/etc/qmqp.cdb:

     /usr/bin/tcprules /etc/indimail/etc/qmqp.cdb \
         /etc/indimail/etc/qmqp.tmp < /etc/indimail/etc/qmqp.tcp

You can change /etc/indimail/etc/qmqp.tcp and run tcprules again at any
time. Finally qmail-qmqpd to be run under supervise:

sudo /usr/sbin/svctool --qmqp=628 --servicedir=/service --maxdaemons=75 --maxperip=25 \
        --qbase=/var/indimail/queue --qcount=5 --qstart=1 --cntrldir=control --localip=0 \
         --fsync --syncdir --memory=104857600 --min-free=52428800

628 is the standard TCP port for QMQP.

How do I install indimail-mini?
==============================
A indimail-mini installation is just like a indimail installation, except that it's much easier to set up:

    * You don't need MySQL
    * You don't need /var/indimail/alias. A indimail-mini installation doesn't
      do any local delivery.
    * You don't need indimail entries in /etc/group or /etc/passwd. indimail-mini
      runs with the same privileges as the user sending mail; it doesn't have any
      of its own files.
    * You don't need to start anything from your boot scripts. indimail-mini
      doesn't have a queue, so it doesn't need a long-running queue manager.
    * You don't need to add anything to inetd.conf. A null client doesn't receive incoming mail. 

Here's what you do need:

    * qmail-qmqpc, forward, qmail-inject, sendmail, predate, datemail, mailsubj,
      qmail-showctl, maildirmake, maildir2mbox, maildirwatch, qail, elq, and pinq
      in /usr/bin;
    * a symbolic link to qmail-qmqpc from /usr/sbin/qmail-queue;
    * symbolic links to /usr/bin/sendmail from /usr/sbin/sendmail
      and /usr/lib/sendmail;
    * all the manual pages in /usr/share/man/man;
    * a list of IP addresses of QMQP servers, one per line, in
      /etc/indimail/control/qmqpservers;
    * a copy of /etc/indimail/control/me, /etc/indimail/control/defaultdomain,
      and /etc/indimail/control/plusdomain from your central server, so
      that qmail-inject uses appropriate host names in outgoing mail; and
    * this host's name in /etc/indimail/control/idhost, so that qmail-inject
      generates Message-ID without any risk of collision. 

Everything can be shared across hosts except for /etc/indimail/control/idhost.

Remember that users won't be able to send mail if all the QMQP servers are down.
Most sites have two or three independent QMQP servers.

Note that users can still use all the qmail-inject environment variables to control
the appearance of their outgoing messages.

What about firewalls?
====================
You won't need most of the indimail-mini programs on a firewall, but you will
need qmail-smtpd to accept messages through SMTP. You can survive with a tiny
configuration:

    * /usr/sbin/qmail-qmqpc;
    * /usr/bin/qmail-smtpd;
    * a symbolic link to qmail-qmqpc from /usr/sbin/qmail-queue;
    * the internal gateway's IP address in /etc/indimail/control/qmqpservers;
    * the firewall host's name in /etc/indimail/control/me; and
    * the list of acceptable domains in /etc/indimail/control/rcpthosts. 

You don't need to worry about setting up redundant QMQP servers here. If the internal
gateway is down, qmail-smtpd will temporarily reject the message, and the remote client
will automatically try again later.

What about mailing lists?
========================
Here's how to set up ezmlm to send messages to a smarthost through QMQP:

   1. Create a /var/mini-indimail directory.
   2. Create a /var/mini-indimail/bin directory.
   3. Make a symbolic link to /usr/sbin/qmail-qmqpc from /var/mini-indimail/bin/qmail-queue.
   4. Put the smarthost's IP address into /etc/indimail/control/qmqpservers.
   5. Compile and install ezmlm with /var/mini-qmail in conf-qmail. 

You don't need to worry about setting up redundant QMQP servers here. If the smarthost is down,
the message will stay in the local qmail queue and will be retried later.
