Apart from providing ESMTP, IMAP, POP3 service, IndiMail provides Management of Virtual
domains. IndiMail works on both 32 / 64 bit Unix platforms.
.PP
IndiMail provides qmail-remote / qmail-local, proxyimap & proxypop3 which are user-location
aware (on which server the user's mailbox lies). This gives IndiMail the ability to distribute
the users across multiple hosts using standard non-proprietary protocols and RFCs. The other
use of user-location aware property is to have a single domain consisting of a heterogeneous
email server environment (with some users on MS Exchange and some on Lotus Notes some on
IndiMail). To distribute mails for users across multiple hosts, IndiMail uses \fBqmail-remote(8)\fR.
\fBqmail-remote(8)\fR gives the ability to distribute the mails using SMTP or QMTP. You can
use the \fBROUTES\fR environment variable to "smtp" or "qmtp" to choose the protocol.
You can have multiple hosts hosting a domain placed geographically anywhere and tied
up by IndiMail. The architecture does not force a filesystem architecture like NFS to be used
to distribute the users. In other words, \fBIndiMail\fR allows you to extend a domain across
multiple servers and hence provide the ability to scale to any number of users. Such a domain
which is extended across multiple servers is called a clustered domain. A clustered domain
consists of multiple mailstore and one or many MySQL servers. A mailstore is a host which has
the user's mail storage in Maildir. The MySQL servers hold user information like path of the
Maildir, user privileges, user aliases and forwardings, user's mailstore. The MySQL servers
can be present on the mailstores itself or as individual servers or as a single server holding
information for all users on all mailstores. The configuration is flexible and is left to the
user so that one can optimize on cost or performance.

When an IMAP or POP3 client logs in through proxyimap/proxypop3, the following takes place:
.IP \[bu] 2
The proxy analyzes the login sequence
.sp -1
.IP \[bu]
Extracts the user name of the user trying to login
.sp -1
.IP \[bu]
Does a lookup query on the local server to find out which server the mailbox of the user
attempting to login lives on This lookup service (named \fBinlookup(8)\fR) runs on mailbox
servers and accepts requests on a well defined FIFO.
.PP
IndiMail uses a highly modified qmail and provides all features needed in a
modern MTA. However, all features have been added by re-using the functions/libraries provide
by stock qmail (stralloc, substdio, alloc, str, env, etc). Detailed feature list of IndiMail
is provided on the website http://www.indimail.org
.PP
IndiMail has two databases

.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 2
local database - Contains all user information, attributes
.sp -1
.IP \n+[step]
central database - Used only when configured as a clustered domain. This database is
refered to as '\fBclusterinfo\fR'.

.PP
For a non-clustered architecture, you need a local MySQL database. To connect to this MySQL
database, you need to have a control file \fBhost\.mysql\fR. This control file contains the
IP address or hostname of the MySQL database corresponding to the \fBlocal database\fR. If
the control file \fBhost\.mysql\fR is missing, programs will use \fIlocalhost\fR to connect
to MySQL. One can also use \fIhost:user:password:socket/port\fR format for \fBhost.mysql\fR.

The local database consists of the following tables

.nr step 1 1

.PP
A clustered domain in IndiMail is achieved by having a central MySQL database called
\fIclusterinfo\fR. \fIclusterinfo\fR stores information about the user's storage server
(mailstore) and each mailstore's individual local MySQL database's connection parameters
(host, user, password, socket or port). This database is also referred to as the
\fBcentral database\fR. It consists of the following tables

.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 2
hostcntrl
.sp -1
.IP \n+[step]
host_table
.sp -1
.IP \n+[step]
dbinfo
.sp -1
.IP \n+[step]
smtp_port
.sp -1
.IP \n+[step]
mgmtaccess
.sp -1
.IP \n+[step]
vpriv
.PP
The table \fIhostcntrl\fR has the fields user, domain and hostid. \fIhostid\fR is a unique
identifier which needs to be assigned to every server on which email accounts need to be
created. These servers are also called \fImailstores\fR. The program \fBhostcntrl(8)\fR
can be used to add, modify, delete entries to the table \fIhostcntrl\fR. The program
\fBvadduser(1)\fR also adds user entries to this table. Each \fIhostid\fR needs to be mapped
to an IP address. This is maintained in the table \fIhost_table\fR. A program called
\fBvhostid(8)\fR can be used to add, modify or delete entries in \fIhost_table\fR.
.PP
To be able to access the \fBcentral database\fR, IndiMail programs need the following control
files in the directory CONTROLDIR

.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 2
host.master
.sp -1
.IP \n+[step]
host.cntrl
.PP
These control file contains the IP address or hostname of the MySQL database corresponding to
the \fBcentral database\fR. You can also use \fIhost:user:password:socket/port\fR format for
these control files. If you plan to have a master-slave MySQL architecture, you can have
entry in \fIhost.master\fR pointing to the MySQL master database and have entry in
\fIhost.cntrl\fR pointing to the MySQL slave database. With these control files, all indimail
programs ensure that all writes go to the master database and reads happen only from the slave
database. The control files \fIhost.master\fR, \fIhost.cntrl\fR can be overriden by the
environment variables \fBMASTER_HOST\fR and \fBCNTRL_HOST\fR. One can also give
host:user:password:mysql_socket/port as the format for \fIhost.master\fR and \fIhost.cntrl\fR.
.PP
IndiMail uses \fBgethostid(3)\fR and \fBgetaddrinfo(3)\fR to figure out its identity.
\fBgetaddrinfo(3)\fR requires your hosts address to be either resolved by dns or be present
in \fBhosts(5)\fR /etc/hosts. You can bypass \fBgethostid(3)\fR and \fBgetaddrifno(3)\fR by
have your hostid in \fICONTROLDIR/hostid\fR and your IP address in
\fBCONTROLDIR/localiphost\fR.
.PP
In a clustered setup, you can have multiple servers with each server having its own set of
local users. The information for these users are stored in a MySQL database known as the
\fBlocal database\fR. You can have multiple \fBlocal databases\fR with each database serving one
email server. You can also club user information for multiple email servers in a single MySQL
\fBlocal database\fR. This flexibility helps IndiMail achieve scalability. So apart from the
user's location which is maintained in the \fBcentral database\fR, other user attributes like
home directory, gecos, quota, access rights are maintained in another MySQL database called the
\fBlocal database\fR.
.PP
Access to the individual \fBlocal database\fR by indimail programs is made easy by, having the
parameters needed to connect to each of the MySQL \fBlocal datbase\fR, in a table called
\fIdbinfo\fR, on the \fBcentral database\fR. The same information can be maintained in a control
file \fBCONTROLDIR/mcdinfo\fR. The file \fImcdinfo\fR allows one to maintain and sync
information about each and every \fImailstore\fR on the \fIdbinfo\fR table. The updation
depends on the timestamp of the \fImcdinfo\fR file and \fIdbinfo\fR table. The moment
\fImcdinfo\fR is updated, the same information gets updated in the \fIdbinfo\fR table. The
moment \fIdbinfo\fR gets updated, the file \fImcdinfo\fR on all other \fImailstore\fR (older
than the \fIdbinfo\fR table) gets updated. The entries in \fIdbinfo\fR table / \fImcdinfo\fR
file can be seen by running the \fBdbinfo(8)\fR program. Whenever a new \fImailstore\fR is
added/removed, the entry for the \fImailstore\fR and the corresponding MySQL \fBlocal database\fR
needs to be added/removed in the \fIdbinfo\fR table or \fImcdinfo\fR file. In short, the entries
in the \fIdbinfo\fR table and the \fImcdinfo\fR control file on all servers are kept in sync.
.PP
In case you do not require a multi-host setup, IndiMail does not require \fBcentral database\fR.
Programs just need to connect to the \fBlocal database\fR which can be configured by having the
control file CONTROLDIR/host.mysql.

.SH Virtual Domains
.PP
IndiMail has an idea of email domains that are "local" and "virtual". Local domains are ones
which primarily match against /etc/passwd. Virtual domains match against domains listed in
the control file CONTROLDIR/virtualdomains. IndiMail makes use of the INDIMAIL/users/assign
file and \fIvirtualdomains\fR file. The \fIusers/assign\fR file gets compiled into a \fIusers/cdb\fR
file. It is a hashed database to speed searches for patterns. If a pattern is matched then
IndiMail delivers the email to the directory defined in the file using the uid and gid which is
also defined. IndiMail makes use of this method to deliver all virtual domain email as the
single uid/gid indimail/indimail. It also uses it to take delivery instructions from
INDIMAIL/domains/<virtualdomain>/.qmail-default file. Once qmail-local gets the information from the \fIusers/assign\fR file it performs standard .qmail
file processing in the directory. Normal .qmail-<user> files can be used for forwarding, aliases
or invoking programs such as ezmlm. If no matches are found qmail-local looks for a .qmail-default
file. This is the last stage in qmail-local's delivery mechanism. qmail-local uses this file to
invoke the vdelivermail program. This program takes two parameters, the first is not used (it is
there for backward compatibility). The second parameter is the default delivery if a virtual
domain user can not be found. Basically, it can be one of the following

.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 3
Full path to a indimail user directory 
.sp -1
.IP \n+[step]
email address to forward email to
.sp -1
.IP \n+[step]
the string bounce-no-mailbox to bounce the email back to the sender.
.sp -1
.IP \n+[step]
Address in SMTPROUTE format to which \fBvdelivermail\fR should use SMTP to deliver the mail.
e.g.

.EX
indimail.org:192.168.1.55:25
.EE

where indimail.org is the local domain, 192.168.1.55 is the IP address of an SMTP server
for indimail.org and 25 is the SMTP port.

.SH Virtual Domain Directory Structure Layout
IndiMail uses an adaptive directory structure based on a table \fIdir-control\fR which is
automatically managed by the core programs \fBvadduser(1)\fR and \fBvdeluser\fR. The basic
idea is to break up the user Maildir directories across multiple directories and sub
directories so that there are never more than 100 user directories in a single directory.

In a single file system, the default directory setup allows for 62 directories in 3 levels
and 100 user directories per directory. The total number of user directories is equal to
(62 * 100) + (62 * 62 * 100) + (62 * 62 * 62 * 100) = over 24 million directories per filesystem.
This should be more than sufficient for any site and probably goes beyond the technology
of directory structures. 

If you are going to be storing large numbers of user directories, make sure you set your
file system to have a higher than normal percentage of inodes. 

IndiMail will automatically create these directories and sub directories as needed and
populate each directory with up to 100 user accounts. As soon as a directory reaches
100 users it will create the next directory or sub directory and store the new users
directory there. 

You can use the \fBvreorg(8)\fR program to recreate the \fIdir-control\fR table.

.SH Environment Variables
Some IndiMail programs set or use environment variables. The following
table lists these variables and describes their use.

.SH STARTUP
IndiMail uses svscan(8) to start, monitor and restart (if neccessary) all services needed
for proper functioning of email server. svscan is installed as an entry in /etc/inittab on
systems which use \fBinit(8)\fR. Some of the newer systems come with \fBupstart(8)\fR, in whih case,
svscan is installed in /etc/event.d. On MacOS the file indimail.plist in the directory
/System/Library/LaunchDaemons is used by launchctl to start IndiMail.

.PP
The program \fBinitsvc(1)\fR can be used to enable svscan to get automatically started on
system boot. All services are installed in /service which each directory representing a
service. These services are started and monitored by \fBsupervise(8)\fR. The table below
gives all the service directories in /service.

.TE

The services on port 25, 587, 110, 4110, 143, 4143 support STARTTLS

You can use \fBsvc(8)\fR to start / stop individual services. To disable / enable all services,
you can use the \fBinitsvc(8)\fR command.

IndiMail attempts to be as portable as possible across different system. You can use
any of the following two commands to start IndiMail on all systems

.EX
 # service indimail start
 or 
 # initsvc -on
.EE

.SH POST Execution Handle
Some indimail programs have a post execution handle. A post execution handle is a program with
the same name as that of the calling program but in the directory INDIMAIL/libexec.
On successful completion, such programs execute the handle program and return
the status of the called handle program. If the handle program is not accessible, the return
status is zero. Normally, the handle program always gets executed from INDIMAIL/libexec
directory, but you can override the program called by setting the environment variable
\fBPOST_HANDLE\fR.

Post execution handle is useful when you want to achieve a task that is beyond the scope of IndiMail's
programs. These handle help you to extend the functionality of indimail programs when adding domains,
adding users, modifying a domain or modifying a user. These handles are passed arguments depending
on the arguments passed to the original program. See the section on \fBPOST HANDLE\fR in the
man page for the programs mentioned below having post execution handle.

Programs that support this post execution handle are vadddomain(1), vdeldomain(1), vrenamedomain(1),
vadduser(1), vdeluser(1), vrenameuser(1), vmoveuser(1), vpasswd(1).

The distribution includes two post execution handles \fBvadddomain\fR and \fBvadduser\fR.

.SH Download/Repository
IndiMail provides the package in both source and binary forms. Installation from the source
requires you to download other packages from the respective websites apart from the indimail
core package. The indimail package contains a patch directory which allows you to add features
to qmail, ucspi-tcp, courier-imap, etc. Details for building IndiMail from source can be read
in the INSTALL document provided with the source package. Many users may find this complicated
and hence binary packages are also provided which can be downloaded from the RPM repo mentioned
below.
