Please note that this version of qmailadmin is a hacked version of Qmailadmin
available at sourceforge.net. It has been hacked to work with IndiMail.

I have absolutely no knowledge of how things on web work. However, using a bit of
common sense, I have been able to make it work (mostly) with IndiMail. Few things
like autoresponder, may not work. I will work on it.
Please don't bug the original authors if this does not work.

Note that QmailAdmin is now a SourceForge project.  Please check there for 
up to date information.
