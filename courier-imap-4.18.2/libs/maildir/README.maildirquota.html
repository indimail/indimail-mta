  <h2>HOWTO.maildirquota</h2>

  <p>The remaining portion of this document is a technical
  description of the maildir quota extension. This section is a
  brief overview of this extension.</p>

  <h3>What is a maildirquota?</h3>

  <p>If you would like to have a quota on your maildir mailboxes,
  the best solution is to always use filesystem-based quotas:
  per-user usage quotas that is enforced by the operating
  system.</p>

  <p>This is the best solution when the default Maildir is located
  in each account's home directory. This solution will NOT work if
  Maildirs are stored elsewhere, or if you have a large virtual
  domain setup where a single userid is used to hold many
  individual Maildirs, one for each virtual user.</p>

  <p>This extension to the maildir format allows a "voluntary"
  maildir quota implementation that does not rely on
  filesystem-based quotas.</p>

  <h3>When maildirquota will not work.</h3>

  <p>For this quota mechanism to work, all software that accesses a
  maildir must observe this quota protocol. It follows that this
  quota mechanism can be easily circumvented if users have direct
  (shell) access to the filesystem containing the users'
  maildirs.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, this quota mechanism is not 100% effective. It is
  possible to have a situation where someone may go over quota.
  This quota implementation uses a deliverate trade-off. It is
  necessary to use some form of locking in order to have a complete
  bulletproof quota enforcement, but maildirs mail stores were
  explicitly designed to avoid any kind of locking. This quota
  approach does not use locking, and the tradeoff is that sometimes
  it is possible for a few extra messages to be delivered to the
  maildir, before the door is permanently shot.</p>

  <p>For best performance, all maildir clients should support this
  quota extension, however there's a wide degree of tolerance here.
  As long as the mail delivery agent that puts new messages into a
  Maildir uses this extension, the quota will be enforced without
  excessive degradation.</p>

  <p>In the worst case scenario, quotas are automatically
  recalculated every fifteen minutes. If a maildir goes over quota,
  and a mail client that does not support this quota extension
  removes enough mail from the maildir, the mail delivery agent
  will not be immediately informed that the maildir is now under
  quota. However, eventually the correct quota will be recalculated
  and mail delivery will resume.</p>

  <p>Mail user agents sometimes put messages into the maildir
  themselves. Messages added to a maildir by a mail user agent that
  does not understand the quota extension will not be immediately
  counted towards the overall quota, and may not be counted for an
  extensive period of time. Additionally, if there are a lot of
  messages that have been added to a maildir from these mail user
  agents, quota recalculation may impose non-trivial load on the
  system, as the quota recalculator will have to issue the stat
  system call for each message.</p>

  <h3>How to implement the quota</h3>

  <p>The best way to do that is to modify your mail server to
  implement the protocol defined by this document. Not everyone, of
  course, has this ability. Therefore, an alternate approach is
  available.</p>

  <p>This package builds two small utility programs:
  "<tt>maildirmake</tt>" and "<tt>deliverquota</tt>".
  <tt>maildirmake</tt> is an extended version of the Maildir
  creation utility, with some additional options, including quota
  support.</p>

  <p>The <tt>-qoptions to maildirmake installs the
  <tt>maildirsize</tt> file in an existing Maildir, which enables
  quota support:</tt></p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
maildirmake -q 10000000S ./Maildir
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p><tt>./Maildir</tt> is an existing maildir, and this -q options
  sets a quota of about 10 megabytes.</p>

  <p><tt>deliverquota</tt> reads the message from standard input,
  then delivers it to the maildir specified by the first argument
  to <tt>deliverquota</tt>, observing any quota that's set for the
  maildir. If the maildir is over quota, <tt>deliverquota</tt>
  terminates with exit code 77. Otherwise, it delivers the message,
  updates the quota, and terminates with exit code 0.</p>

  <p>You will need to configure your mail server to use
  <tt>deliverquota</tt> instead of delivering directly to maildirs.
  The instructions for doing so depends on which mail server you
  use. For example, if you use Qmail and your maildirs are all
  located in $HOME/Maildir, replace the '<tt>./Maildir/</tt>'
  argument to <tt>qmail-start</tt> with the following:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
'| /usr/local/bin/deliverquota ./Maildir'
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Then, run <tt>maildirmake</tt> with the <tt>-q</tt> option to
  set up quotas on all the maildirs.</p>

  <p>That's pretty much it. If you handle a moderate amount of
  mail, I have one more suggestion. If possible, use
  <tt>deliverquota</tt> to deliver mail for a few weeks beforing
  setting up any quotas. Even if quotas are not used,
  <tt>deliverquota</tt> uses certain optimizations that permit very
  fast quota recalculation. Messages delivered by
  <tt>deliverquota</tt> have their message size encoded in their
  filename; this makes it possible to avoid stat-ing all files in
  the Maildir, when recalculating the quota. Then, after most
  messages in your maildirs have been delivered by
  <tt>deliverquota</tt>, activate the quotas.</p>

  <h3>maildirquota-enhanced applications</h3>

  <p>This is a list of applications that have been enhanced to
  support the maildirquota extension:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href=
    "http://www.courier-mta.org/maildrop/">maildrop</a> - mail
    delivery agent/mail filter.</li>

    <li><a target="_blank" href=
    "http://www.courier-mta.org/sqwebmail/">SqWebMail</a> - webmail
    CGI binary.</li>

    <li><a target="_blank" href=
    "http://www.courier-mta.org/imap/">Courier-IMAP</a> - an IMAP
    server</li>

    <li><a target="_blank" href=
    "http://www.courier-mta.org">Courier</a> - all of the
    above</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Quotas and deleted messages</h3>

  <p>The default application configuration that uses this
  maildirquota library does not count deleted messages, and any
  contents of the Trash folder, against the quota. Messages that
  are marked as deleted (but not yet actually removed), or messages
  that are moved to the Trash folder (which is subject to automatic
  purging) do not count towards the set quota.</p>

  <p>It is possible to recompile the library to include all
  messages in the Maildir against the quota. This is done by using
  the <tt>--with-trashquota</tt> option to the configure script.
  Note that this option MUST be used to compile EVERY application
  that uses this maildirquota library. So, for example, if you have
  both <tt>maildrop</tt> and <tt>SqWebMail</tt> installed, you must
  use this option to recompile both applications.</p>

  <h2>Mission statement</h2>Maildir++ is a mail storage structure
  that's based on the Maildir structure, first used in the Qmail
  mail server. Actually, Maildir++ is just a minor extension to the
  standard Maildir structure.

  <p>For more information, see <tt><a target="_blank" href=
  "http://www.courier-mta.org/maildir.html">http://www.courier-mta.org/maildir.html</a></tt>.
  I am not going to include the definition of a Maildir in this
  document. Consider it included right here. This document only
  describes the differences.</p>

  <p>Maildir++ adds a couple of things to a standard Maildir:
  folders and quotas.</p>

  <p>Quotas enforce a maximum allowable size of a Maildir. In many
  situations, using the quota mechanism of the underlying
  filesystem won't work very well. If a filesystem quota mechanism
  is used, then when a Maildir goes over quota, Qmail does not
  bounce additional mail, but keeps it queued, changing one bad
  situation into another bad situation. Not only do you have an
  account that's backed up, but now your queue starts to back up
  too.</p>

  <h2>Definitions, and goals</h2>Maildir++ and Maildir shall be
  completely interchangeable. A Maildir++ client will be able to
  use a standard Maildir, automatically "upgrading" it in the
  process. A Maildir client will be able to use a Maildir++ just
  like a regular Maildir. Of course, a plain Maildir client won't
  be able to enforce a quota, and won't be able to access messages
  stored in folders.

  <p>Folders are created as subdirectories under the main Maildir.
  The name of the subdirectory always starts with a period. For
  example, a folder named "Important" will be a subdirectory called
  ".Important". You can't have subdirectories that start with two
  periods.</p>

  <p>A Maildir++ client ignores anything in the main Maildir that
  starts with a period, but is not a subdirectory.</p>

  <p>Each subdirectory is a fully-fledged Maildir of its own, that
  is you have .Important/tmp, .Important/new, and .Important/cur.
  Everything that applies to the main Maildir applies equally well
  to the subdirectory, including automatically cleaning up old
  files in tmp. A Maildir++ enhancement is that a message can be
  moved between folders and/or the main Maildir simply by
  moving/renaming the file (into the cur subdirectory of the
  destination folder). Therefore, the entire Maildir++ must reside
  on the same filesystem.</p>

  <p>Within each subdirectory there's an empty file,
  <tt>maildirfolder</tt>. Its existence tells the mail delivery
  agent that this Maildir is a really a folder underneath a parent
  Maildir++.</p>

  <p>Only one special folder is reserved: Trash (subdirectory
  .Trash). Instead of marking deleted messages with the D flag,
  Maildir++ clients move the message into the Trash folder.
  Maildir++ readers are responsible for expunging messages from
  Trash after a system-defined retention interval.</p>

  <p>When a Maildir++ reader sees a message marked with a D flag it
  may at its option: remove the message immediately, move it into
  Trash, or ignore it.</p>

  <p>Can folders have subfolders, defined in a recursive fashion?
  The answer is no. If you want to have a client with a hierarchy
  of folders, emulate it. Pick a hierarchy separator character, say
  ":". Then, folder foo/bar is subdirectory .foo:bar.</p>

  <p>This is all that there's to say about folders. The rest of
  this document deals with quotas.</p>

  <p>The purpose of quotas is to temporarily disable a Maildir, if
  it goes over the quota. There is one and only major goal that
  this quota implementation tries to achieve:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Place as little overhead as possible on the mail system
    that's delivering to the Maildir++</li>
  </ul>That's it. To achieve that goal, certain compromises are
  made:

  <ul>
    <li>Mail delivery will stop as soon as possible after
    Maildir++'s size goes over quota. Certain race conditions may
    happen with Maildir++ going a lot over quota, in rare
    circumstances. That is taken into account, and the situation
    will eventually resolve itself, but you should not simply take
    your systemwide quota, multiply it by the number of mail
    accounts, and allocate that much disk space. Always leave room
    to spare.</li>

    <li>How well the quota mechanism will work will depend on
    whether or not everything that accesses the Maildir++ is a
    Maildir++ client. You can have a transition period where some
    of your mail clients are just Maildir clients, and things
    should run more or less well. There will be some additional
    load because the size of the Maildir will be recalculated more
    often, but the additional load shouldn't be noticeable.</li>
  </ul>This won't be a perfect solution, but it will hopefully be
  good enough. Maildirs are simply designed to rely on the
  filesystem to enforce individual quotas. If a filesystem-based
  quota works for you, use it.

  <p>A Maildir++ may contain the following additional file:
  maildirsize.</p>

  <h2>Contents of <tt>maildirsize</tt></h2>

  <p><tt>maildirsize</tt> contains two or more lines terminated by
  newline characters.</p>

  <p>The first line contains a copy of the quota definition as used
  by the system's mail server. Each application that uses the
  maildir must know what it's quota is. Instead of configuring each
  application with the quota logic, and making sure that every
  application's quota definition for the same maildir is exactly
  the same, the quota specification used by the system mail server
  is saved as the first line of the <tt>maildirsize</tt> file. All
  other application that enforce the maildir quota simply read the
  first line of <tt>maildirsize</tt>.</p>

  <p>The quota definition is a list, separate by commas. Each
  member of the list consists of an integer followed by a letter,
  specifying the nature of the quota. Currently defined quota types
  are 'S' - total size of all messages, and 'C' - the maximum count
  of messages in the maildir. For example, 10000000S,1000C
  specifies a quota of 10,000,000 bytes or 1,000 messages,
  whichever comes first.</p>

  <p>All remaining lines all contain two whitespace-delimited
  integers. The first integer is interpreted as a byte count. The
  second integer is interpreted as a file count. A Maildir++ writer
  can add up all byte counts and file counts from
  <tt>maildirsize</tt> and enforce a quota based either on number
  of messages or the total size of all the messages.</p>

  <p>The current implementation of Maildir++ in Courier inserts
  whitespace padding on each line so that each line (including the
  terminating \n) is 14 bytes in size. This minimizes the impact of
  appending-related bugs in some NFS implementations.</p>

  <h2>Calculating <tt>maildirsize</tt></h2>

  <p>In most cases, changes to <tt>maildirsize</tt> are recorded by
  appending an additional line. Under some conditions
  <tt>maildirsize</tt> has to be recalculated from scratch. These
  conditions are defined later. This is the procedure that's used
  to recalculate <tt>maildirsize</tt>:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>If we find a <tt>maildirfolder</tt> within the directory,
    we're delivering to a folder, so back up to the parent
    directory, and start again.</li>

    <li>Read the contents of the new and cur subdirectories. Also,
    read the contents of the new and cur subdirectories in each
    Maildir++ folder, except Trash. Before reading each
    subdirectory, stat() the subdirectory itself, and keep track of
    the latest timestamp you get.</li>

    <li>If the filename of each message is of the form
    xxxxx,S=nnnnn or xxxxx,S=nnnnn:xxxxx where "xxxxx" represents
    arbitrary text, then use nnnnn as the size of the file (which
    will be conveniently recorded in the filename by a Maildir++
    writer, within the conventions of filename naming in a
    Maildir). If the message was not written by a Maildir++ writer,
    stat() it to obtain the message size. If stat() fails, a race
    condition removed the file, so just ignore it and move on to
    the next one.</li>

    <li>When done, you have the grand total of the number of
    messages and their total size. Create a new maildirsize by:
    creating the file in the tmp subdirectory, observing the
    conventions for writing to a Maildir. Then rename the file as
    <tt>maildirsize</tt>. Afterwards, stat all new and cur
    subdirectories again. If you find a timestamp later than the
    saved timestamp, either remove <tt>maildirsize</tt> and
    proceed, or repeat the recalculation.</li>

    <li>Before running this calculation procedure, the Maildir++
    user wanted to know the size of the Maildir++, so return the
    calculated values. This is done even if <tt>maildirsize</tt>
    was removed.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Calculating the quota for a Maildir++</h2>

  <p>This is the procedure for reading the contents of
  <tt>maildirsize</tt> for the purpose of determine if the
  Maildir++ is over quota.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>If <tt>maildirsize</tt> does not exist, or if its size is
    at least 5120 bytes, recalculate it using the procedure defined
    above, and use the recalculated numbers. Otherwise, read the
    contents of maildirsize, and add up the totals.</li>

    <li>The most efficient way of doing this is to: open
    <tt>maildirsize</tt>, then start reading it into a 5120 byte
    buffer (some broken NFS implementations may return less than
    5120 bytes read even before reaching the end of the file). If
    we fill it, which, in most cases, will happen with one read,
    close it, and run the recalculation procedure.</li>

    <li>In many cases the quota calculation is for the purpose of
    adding or removing messages from a Maildir++, so keep the file
    descriptor to <tt>maildirsize</tt> open. A file descriptor will
    not be available if quota recalculation ended up removing
    <tt>maildirsize</tt> due to a race condition, so the caller may
    or may not get a file descriptor together with the Maildir++
    size.</li>

    <li>If the numbers we got indicated that the Maildir++ is over
    quota, some additional logic is in order: if we did not
    recalculate <tt>maildirsize</tt>, if the numbers in
    <tt>maildirsize</tt> indicated that we are over quota, then if
    <tt>maildirsize</tt> was more than one line long, or if the
    timestamp on <tt>maildirsize</tt> indicated that it's at least
    15 minutes old, throw out the totals, and recalculate
    <tt>maildirsize</tt> from scratch.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Eventually the 5120 byte limitation will always cause
  maildirsize to be recalculated, which will compensate for any
  race conditions which previously threw off the totals. Each time
  a message is delivered or removed from a Maildir++, one line is
  added to maildirsize (this is described below in greater detail).
  Most messages are less than 10K long, so each line appended to
  maildirsize will be either between seven and nine bytes long
  (four bytes for message count, space, digit 1, newline, optional
  minus sign in front of both counts if the message was removed).
  This results in about 640 Maildir++ operations before a
  recalculation is forced. Since most messages are added once and
  removed once from a Maildir, expect recalculation to happen
  approximately every 320 messages, keeping the overhead of a
  recalculation to a minimum. Even if most messages include large
  attachments, most attachments are less than 100K long, which
  brings down the average recalculation frequency to about 150
  messages.</p>

  <p>Also, the effect of having non-Maildir++ clients accessing the
  Maildir++ is reduced by forcing a recalculation when we're
  potentially over quota. Even if non-Maildir++ clients are used to
  remove messages from the Maildir, the fact that the Maildir++ is
  still over quota will be verified every 15 minutes.</p>

  <h2>Delivering to a Maildir++</h2>

  <p>Delivering to a Maildir++ is like delivering to a Maildir,
  with the following exceptions:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Follow the usual Maildir conventions for naming the
    filename used to store the message, except that append ,S=nnnnn
    to the name of the file, where nnnnn is the size of the file.
    This eliminates the need to stat() most messages when
    calculating the quota. If the size of the message is not known
    at the beginning, append ,S=nnnnn when renaming the message
    from tmp to new.</li>

    <li>As soon as the size of the message is known (hopefully
    before it is written into tmp), calculate Maildir++'s quota,
    using the procedure defined previously. If the message is over
    quota, back out, cleaning up anything that was created in
    tmp.</li>

    <li>If a file descriptor to <tt>maildirsize</tt> was opened for
    us, after moving the file from tmp to new append a line to the
    file containing the message size, and "1".</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Reading from a Maildir++</h2>

  <p>Maildir++ readers should mind the following additional
  tasks:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Make sure to create the <tt>maildirfolder</tt> file in any
    new folders created within the Maildir++.</li>

    <li>When moving a message to the Trash folder, append a line to
    maildirsize, containing a negative message size and a
    '-1'.</li>

    <li>When moving a message from the Trash folder, follow the
    steps described in "Delivering to Maildir++", as far as quota
    logic goes. That is, refuse to move messages out of Trash if
    the Maildir++ is over quota.</li>

    <li>Moving a message between other folders carries no
    additional requirements.</li>
  </ol>
