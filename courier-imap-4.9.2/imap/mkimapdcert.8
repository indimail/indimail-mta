.SH NAME
mkimapdcert \- create a test SSL certificate for IMAP over SSL
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fB/var/indimail/sbin/mkimapdcert\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
IMAP over SSL requires a valid, signed, X.509 certificate.  The default
location for the certificate file is
\fI/var/indimail/share/imapd.pem\fR\&.
\fBmkimapdcert\fR generates a self-signed X.509 certificate,
mainly for
testing.
For production use the X.509 certificate must be signed by a
recognized certificate authority, in order for mail clients to accept the
certificate.
.PP
\fI/var/indimail/share/imapd.pem\fR must be owned by the
root user and
have no group or world permissions.
The \fBmkimapdcert\fR command will
enforce this.  To prevent an unfortunate accident,
\fBmkimapdcert\fR
will not work if \fB/var/indimail/share/imapd.pem\fR already exists.
.PP
\fBmkimapdcert\fR requires
\fBOpenSSL\fR to be installed.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\fB/var/indimail/share/imapd.pem\fR
X.509 certificate.
.TP
\fB/var/indimail/etc/imapd.cnf\fR
Parameters used by OpenSSL to
create the X.509 certificate.
