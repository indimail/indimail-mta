<P><BR><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Would anybody be interested in a
package which combines qmail with other packages like courier-imap
for IMAP/POP3, bogofilter for SPAM control, fetchmail for hosts with
intermittent connectivity, ability for a single domain to have users
across multiple hosts (even across different geographical locations)
and tools to manage virtual domains ?<BR><BR>As a hobby way back in
2001, I started playing with qmail. Over the years, i learnt how to
use qmail and put together a complete solution which worked quite
well for me and can work for large ISP installations (&gt; 8 million+
users in a single domain across multiple hosts and more than 4
million deliveries per day). Maybe some of the stuff could prove
useful for someone who had the same situation as me (very little
budget to buy costly NAS filers, availability of simple hardware,
etc). So with this thoughts, I am attempting my first big
contribution to open source. I am not sure how one releases code. But
I have opened a project called '<A HREF="http://www.indimail.org/" NAME="Indimail - Reclaim Your Email">IndiMail</A>'.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since I know very little of how to
release an open source package (GPL), i would most likely could do
well with suggestions/ideas. I do not have my own hosting site. So I
am thinking of using sourceforge. I hope using sourceforge will not
be a rocket science for me. I have a full time job and that is one
thing that may not allow me to put my full time on this. Also this
was one of the reason, I have hesitated for so long to release this.
Now that DJB has released some of his code to <A HREF="http://cr.yp.to/distributors.html">public
domain</A>. But better late than never. I am currently reading up on
how to use sourceforge. I have done most of the documentation. But
need some time to start uploading things on sourceforge so that
everyone can use it. Is there any sourceforge for dummies? The
INSTALL is <A HREF="http://indimail.blogspot.com/2008/06/installing-indimail.html">here.</A></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There is no warranty implied or

this is simply an attempt to give back to the OpenSource community.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If any modification or addition has
been done to DJB's code, it has been done in the same style (not
using the standard C library and using only DJB's functions like
substdio, stralloc, etc). All man pages have been modified to reflect
changes.<BR><BR>This package also allows me to split my users in a
single domain across multiple hosts without using NFS. I haven't
looked at qmail-ldap but maybe this package does something like
qmail-ldap but with MySQL as the backend for storing user
information. The tools for administering virtual domains/users will
have a lot in similarity to the vpopmail package from inter7.com. The
table structures are the same. Plenty of code (for managing virtual
domains/users) has been borrowed from there. Since the user get split
across multiple hosts, IndiMail also provides two proxies for IMAP &amp;
POP3 protocol. The proxy servers run using daemontools and are by
default set under supervise. You can use any IMAP/POP3 server behind
the proxy. IndiMail also allows you to add any proprietory mail
server serving some of the users of any domain which you want to
configure under indimail. This makes it easy to migrate from an
existing proprietory mail server like MS Exchange in 5 steps. The

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>The credit for inspiration to
write/put together this package is entire due to Dr. Daniel
Bernstein. Had he not written qmail the way it is written, i wouldn't
probably have fallen in love with the code. In no way is this package
endorsed by DJB. Though I have put in lot of effort putting together
this package, any bugs or flaws could be entirely due to me. So I
would be glad if the community could further improve this. Since I
have gained so much personally as well as professionally due to
qmail, the least I can do is to put back my experiences and learnings
for anyone who would be interested. I release my entire code as Open
Source GPL.<BR><BR>My contribution is miniscule compared to what I
have picked up from others in building the packages. Since this was
being done for my own personal use, over the years, I may have missed
mentioning some parts of the code that has been written by others. In
case you know that I have missed out giving credit to anyone for any
of the code or idea, let me know and I will be glad to add it here.</P>
