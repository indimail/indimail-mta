Some hints about testing SPAMCONTROL
------------------------------------

1. To test SPAMCONTROL you can TELNET
   to your MTA's SMTP Port address (25).
2. Your TELNET client should be instructed
   to use <LF> as delimitor and local echo.
3. A test sequence:

	qmailer.fehcom.de ESMTP
	helo du
	250 qmailer.fehcom.de
	mail from: <spamtest@[200.194.96.32]>
	250 ok
	rcpt to: <me@[127.0.0.1]>
	250 ok
	data
	354 go ahead
	.
	250 ok 955896938 qp 421
	quit
	221 qmailer.fehcom.de

4. Syntax:
The commands MAIL and RCPT have (at least) two arguments:

- MAIL from: blabla
       ----- ------
       1.    2. Argument

- RCPT to: blabla
       --- ------
       1.  2. Argument

Between the command and the first argument and 
between the first and the second argument there
has to be exactly a "white space" (blank).
The 2nd argument (the SENDER/RECIPIENT) should
be enclosed in "<" and ">".

5. Recommendation: 
It is easy enough to make mistakes!
Delete and Backspace is not allowed!
Watch the behavior in the Log!
