Marcelo Coelho - qmail-srs-0.4.patch

Configure instructions
======================

1. Configure some parameters in /etc/indimail/control.
   Required parameters:

   echo srs.YOURDOMAIN > /etc/indimail/control/srs_domain
   echo SECRET > /etc/indimail/control/srs_secrets

   YOURDOMAIN: Replace with your domain name, e.g. srs.foo-bar.com
   SECRET: Replace with a random string

   Important! You MUST create a MX record for srs.YOURDOMAIN pointing to your server.

   Optional parameters:

   echo 7 > /etc/indimail/control/srs_maxage
   echo 4 > /etc/indimail/control/srs_hashlength
   echo 4 > /etc/indimail/control/srs_hashmin
   echo = > /etc/indimail/control/srs_separator
   echo 0 > /etc/indimail/control/srs_alwaysrewrite

2. Configure your SRS domain.
   echo srs.YOURDOMAIN >> /etc/indimail/control/rcpthosts
   echo srs.YOURDOMAIN:srs >> /etc/indimail/control/virtualdomains
   echo "| /usr/bin/srsfilter" > /var/indimail/alias/.qmail-srs-default

   YOURDOMAIN: Replace with your domain name, e.g. srs.foo-bar.com.

Configuration Parameters
========================

Parameters in bold are required.

Parameter          Description                                            Example
srs_domain         A domain to use in rewritten addresses.                srs.foo-bar.com
                   If not set, SRS is disabled.
srs_secrets        A random string to generate and check SRS addresses.   foobar123
                   You can specify a list of secrets (one per line).
                   The first secret in the list is used for generating
                   new SRS addresses. All secrets on the list may be
                   used to verify SRS addresses.
srs_maxage         The maximum permitted age of a rewritten address.      7
                   SRS rewritten addresses expire after a specified
                   number of days. libsrs2 default is 21, but I believe
                   that a week is enougth to get all bounces, so I
                   recommend you to use 7.
srs_hashlength     The hash length to generate in a rewritten address.    4
                   The hash length is a measure of security in the SRS
                   system; longer is more secure.
srs_hashmin        The hash length to require when checking an address.   4
                   If the hash length is increased, there may be SRS
                   addresses from your MTA in the wild which use a
                   shorter hash length. This parameter may be set
                   to permit checking of hashes shorter than
                   srs_hashlength. This parameter must be at most
                   srs_hashlength.
srs_separator      The separator to appear immediately after SRS[01] in   =
                   rewritten addresses. This must be -, + or =.
                   Default value is =.
srs_alwaysrewrite  Skip rcpthosts check and perform SRS rewriting for all 0
                   forwarding, even when not required. This must be 0
                   (disabled) or 1 (enabled). Default value
                   is 0 (disabled).

Environment Variables (qmail-inject only)
=====================

By default, this patch modifies qmail-inject to rewrite the envelope sender only if EXT
and HOST variables are set.

You can change this behavior using the following environment variables:

QMAILINJECT_FORCE_SRS: qmail-inject will call srsforward() even if EXT and HOST are not set.
QMAILINJECT_SKIP_SRS: qmail-inject will not call srsforward() even if EXT and HOST are set.
