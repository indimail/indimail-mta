.SH SYNOPSIS
.B recipient-cdb
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B recipient-cdb
does a chdir to ASSIGN and
reads the addresses provided in
.BR recipients ,
converts them into lowercase, and writes them into
.B recipients.cdb
in a binary format suited
for quick access by
.BR qmail-smtpd .

If there is a problem with
.BR recipients ,
.B recipient-cdb
complains and leaves
.B recipients.cdb
alone.

.B recipient-cdb
ensures that
.B recipients.cdb
is updated atomically,
so
.B qmail-smtpd
never has to wait for
.B recipient-cdb
to finish.
However,
.B recipient-cdb
makes no attempt to protect against two simultaneous updates of
.BR recipients.cdb .

The binary
.B recipients.cdb
is compatible with 
.B setforward
generated \'fastforward\' cdbs and it's
format is portable across machines.
