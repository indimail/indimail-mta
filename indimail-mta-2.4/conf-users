The qmail system is heavily partitioned for security; it does almost
nothing as root.

The first nine lines of this file are the alias user, the daemon user,
the log user, the owner of miscellaneous files such as binaries, the
passwd user, the queue user, the remote user, the send user, the
indimail user and the virus scan user.
