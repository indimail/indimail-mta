SQLITE3 DATABASE DRIVER FOR BOGOFILTER
======================================

$Id: README.sqlite 6901 2010-04-01 16:05:05Z m-a $

This document only applies if you want to use bogofilter with SQLite3
databases.

1. Overview -----------------------------------------------------------

Bogofilter 0.93.3 and newer can use recent SQLite3 versions to store
their tokens; see section 2.1 below for supported versions.

SQLite is a database that handles a large SQL subset and stores all
tables in one permanent file, and the journal for changes in one
temporary file that gets automatically removed when no longer needed.
SQLite3 ships with a command-line client for the shell, named sqlite3.

2. Prerequisites ------------------------------------------------------

2.1 Compatibility - supported SQLite versions

At this time, only SQLite v3.6.13, and v3.6.22 and newer are supported.
Please check the SQLite website <http://sqlite.org/> for upgrade
recommendations.
  Older versions back to 3.0.8 may work, but you are advised to
carefully review the sqlite3 ChangeLog, because there have been several
important bug fixes since 3.0.8, including fixes for bugs that can
corrupt the database.  Note that sqlite v3.3.9 and newer sometimes
generate error messages that are clearer when executing SQL statements
(that bogofilter generates internally).

Bogofilter prints a warning (but continues to run) when used with SQLite
versions older than v3.6.12. This warning can be suppressed by defining
the environment variable BF_USE_OLD_SQLITE to any value, including the
empty value.

The Oracle Berkeley DB SQLite3 API that is available since Berkeley DB
5.0.21 is unsupported.  Use Berkeley DB's native API instead, see
README.db for details.


2.2 Installation

To use bogofilter with the SQLite3 back-end driver, you must install a
sufficiently recent SQLite3 version before configuring bogofilter. You
can download SQLite 3 and find installation instructions for SQLite 3 at
<http://sqlite.org/>, the SQLite installation is pretty straightforward.

After that, you can configure bogofilter, add --with-database=sqlite
to the ./configure command.

3. Use ----------------------------------------------------------------

3.1 Care and feeding

SQLite is pretty self-maintaining.  After larger maintenance operations
to remove older tokens you may want to run this command:

    sqlite3 ~/.bogofilter/wordlist.db 'VACUUM;'

to remove unused pages from the database file and reduce the file size.

A. Miscellaneous ------------------------------------------------------

A.1 Why does bogofilter use BLOB for both columns?

bogofilter has traditionally managed its own data structure inside key
and value, BLOB allows the verbatim retrieval of such data without
stumbling across embedded NUL characters and without adding even more
translations between data formats.
