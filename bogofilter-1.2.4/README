0. IMPORTANT
------------

If you are using bogofilter with the Berkeley DB data base library
(which is the default, received most testing, is the most powerful of
the data base engines that bogofilter supports and hence recommended),
do read the doc/README.db file, it contains important information.

The doc/README.db file contains troubleshooting information and
requirements that should be read ahead of time so you can fix problems
quickly should they arise later.


1. What is Bogofilter?
----------------------

Bogofilter is a fast Bayesian spam filter along the lines suggested by
Paul Graham in his article "A Plan For Spam":

  http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html

with algorithmic changes suggested by Gary Robinson in:

  http://radio.weblogs.com/0101454/stories/2002/09/16/spamDetection.html

and in "A Statistical Approach to the Spam Problem":

  http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6467

This version improves on the papers by doing smarter lexical analysis.
In particular, hostames and IP addresses are retained as recognition
features rather than broken up. Various kinds of MTA cruft such as
dates and message-IDs are discarded so as not to bloat the word lists.


2. Documentation
----------------

It is recommended, although not necessary, that you install the GNU
Scientific Library (GSL) version 1.4 or newer before configuring
bogofilter. This allows bogofilter to link dynamically against a
system-wide GSL rather than statically against a shipped GSL subset,
conserving memory and disk space.

When installed, there are man pages for bogofilter, bogoutil,
bogolexer, and bogoupgrade.  Additional documentation is in
/usr/share/doc/bogofilter-x.y.z or comparable directory (depending on
your operating system).

If you've installed the source code, the  doc directory and its
subdirectories contain most of bogofilter's documentation.  In it are
a variety of README files, the xml originals for the man pages , and
other documents.  Additionally, many of the directories in the
bogofilter hierarchy have their own README files.

If you use mutt, see the bogofilter(1) manual page for helpful macros
you can add to your .muttrc.


3. Installing Bogofilter
----------------------

When updating, check the RELEASE.NOTES files.

For fresh installs, check the rest of this file and the INSTALL file.

You can safely ignore any of these compile time warnings:

warning: unused parameter ...
warning: format not a string literal, argument types not checked


4. How to contribute
--------------------

The best way to contribute to bogofilter is through the bogofilter
mailing list, bogofilter@bogofilter.org.  You can subscribe to it by
sending a message to bogofilter-subscribe@bogofilter.org and
responding to the confirmation message it sends to you.  More
information is available on the bogofilter home page at
http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net/

Bugs can be reported via the bogfilter mailing list or through
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=499997&group_id=62265&func=browse

If you have code to contribute, please post it on the bogofilter
mailing list or mail it to David Relson (relson@users.sourceforge.net)


5. How to request features
--------------------------

Ask around in the bogofilter mailing list.  The idea may have been
already suggested, considered, accepted, rejected, ...  You won't know
until you ask!

Alternatively, you might want to hack at the code and develop the
feature on your own, which would be great!  You can then send a patch
to the list.


6. Building & Installing Bogofilter from Source Tarball or SVN
--------------------------------------------------------------

  a. Downloading
  --------------

  The most recent version of this software is available at:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/bogofilter/

  The latest stable version can be downloaded.  The development source
  is in a Subversion repository on SourceForge.  To download the latest SVN
  source, cd to the directory to which you wish to download and type
  the following command:

  svn checkout http://svn.code.sf.net/p/bogofilter/code/trunk bogofilter

  b. Building & Installing
  ------------------------

  To compile and install the standard configuration from a tarball, use
  the following commands:

  cd bogofilter-1.0.1	[change to project directory]
  ./configure		[add configure options as required]
  make all check
  make install		[as root]

  To compile and install the standard configuration from SVN, use
  the following commands:

  cd bogofilter		[change to project directory]
  ./autogen.sh		[add configure options as required]
  make install		[as root]

  Be sure to read README.svn for additional preparations required.

  You will need a full set of development tools installed to be able
  to run autogen.sh, including recent automake (1.8) and autoconf
  (2.59). configure does not have these requirements.

  c. Configuring
  --------------

  After using ./autogen.sh, which builds the standard configuration
  and runs "make check" to ensure it works in your environment and on
  your hardware, you might wish to further customize bogofilter for
  your use.

  Running "./configure --help" will list all the configuration
  options.  The most notable ones are:

  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
			  [default: /usr/local]
  --with-database=ENGINE  Choose database engine {db|qdbm|sqlite3} 
  			  [default: db]
  CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/csw/include
			  Choose additional include file path /opt/csw/include
  LDFLAGS=-L/opt/csw/lib  Ditto, for library files

  d. Changing Bogofilter
  ----------------------

  If you make modifications to bogofilter, you may need to have a
  recent DocBook XML tool chain, the xmlto program, PassiveTeX and
  XMLTeX, recent versions of automake (1.8) and autoconf (2.59).

  These requirements do not apply if you are building an unmodified
  tarball.
