+# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
+# $ac_aux_dir to `$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
+# `$srcdir', `$srcdir/..', or `$srcdir/../..'.
+#
+# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
+# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
+# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
+# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
+# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
+# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
+# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
+#
+# $ac_aux_dir/missing
+#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
+# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
+#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
+#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
+#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
+#
+# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
+# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
+# harmless because $srcdir is `.', but things will broke when you
+# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
+#
+# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
+# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
+#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
+# and then we would define $MISSING as
+#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
+# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
+# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
+# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
+# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
+#
+# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
+# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a

+   This function takes an authentication request.  If its valid, it
+   changes its userid/groupid to the one for the authenticated user,
+   changes the current directory to the authenticated user's home directory,
+   and sets the following environment variables:
+
+             MAILDIR - nondefault mailbox location (optional).
+
+             OPTIONS - optional settings.  This is a string containing
+	               comma-delimited "IDENTIFIER=VALUE" tuples.  See
+		       "Account OPTIONS" in INSTALL for more information.
+
+
+2) User lookup function.  This function is prototyped as follows:
+
+     int functionname(const char *userid, const char *service,
+		int (*callback)(struct authinfo *, void *),
+			void *);
+
+     This function populates the following structure:

+	const uid_t *sysuserid;
+	gid_t sysgroupid;
+	const char *homedir;

+	const char *options;
+
+	unsigned staticindex;	/* When statically-linked functions are
+				** called, this holds the index of the
+				** authentication module in authstaticlist */
+
+	} ;
+
+/*
+	Either sysusername or sysuserid may be NULL, but not both of them.
+	They, and sysgroupid, specify the authenticated user's system
+	userid and groupid.  homedir points to the authenticated user's
+	home directory.  address, fullname, and maildir, are obvious.

+	maildir/README.maildirquota).
+
+	'options' is an optional string that contains per-user custom settings.
+	See "OPTIONS" above.
+

+.SH SYNOPSIS
+
+\fBauthpam\fR \fB\fIcommand\fB\fR [ \fB\fIarg\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]

+
+.SH "DESCRIPTION"
+.PP
+This library is used for two purposes:
+.PP
+1. Read an E-mail address that is supposed to be for a local account.
+Determine the local account's home directory, and system userid and
+groupid.
+.PP
+2. Read a login id and a password.
+If valid, determine the account's home directory, system userid, and
+groupid.
+.PP
+The term "authentication" is used in the following documentation to refer
+to either one of these two functions.
+The library contains several alternative authentication implementations,
+that may be selected at runtime.
+.TP
+\fBauthpam\fR
+authenticates using the system's PAM library
+(pluggable authentication module).
+This is, essentially, a way to use existing PAM modules for authentication
+functionality.
+Note, however, that the authenticated account's home directory, userid and
+groupid are still read from the \fI/etc/passwd\fR file,
+since PAM functionality is limited to validating account passwords.
+.TP
+\fBauthpwd\fR
+authenticates from the
+\fI/etc/passwd\fR file.
+.TP
+\fBauthshadow\fR
+like authpwd except passwords
+are read from \fI/etc/shadow\fR\&.
+.TP
+\fBauthcustom\fR
+this is a stub where custom authentication code
+can be added.
+This authentication module is just a stub that doesn't really do anything.
+It's purpose is to serve as a placeholder where custom authentication code
+can be easily added.
+.PP
+This is a complete list of available authentication modules.
+The actual installed authentication modules are determined by the resources
+on the server.
+For example, the authpam authentication module will
+be installed only if the system provides PAM support libraries.
+
+.SH "AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOL"
+.PP
+The rest of this documentation describes the internal protocol used by
+this authentication library.
+It is only of interest to developers who wish to extend the authentication
+library to support a custom authentication module,
+or a derived extension to an existing module.
+.PP
+The original implementation of this authentication library used small,
+self-contained, binary programs, named for their authentication module:
+authshadow,
+authpam, and others.
+
+.SS "STAND-ALONE AUTHENTICATION MODULES"
+.PP
+This section describes the authentication protocol for self-contained
+authentication modules.
+Although the default configuration no longer uses self-contained modules,
+the stand-alone protocol serves as a foundation for the protocol used by
+authentication modules as part of the authdaemond
+authentication process, or when they are linked directly with the application
+that uses this authentication library.
+.PP
+Here's the typical way that stand-alone authentication modules are used:
+.PP
+1. A list of authentication modules are read from a configuration file.
+Multiple authentication modules could be available, but not all of them
+are required in most situations.
+.PP
+2. The application executes the following command:
+.sp
+.RS
+.PP
+
+.nf
+LOGIN AUTHMODULE1 AUTHMODULE2 ... APP
+.fi
+.RE
+.PP
+LOGIN is a full pathname to an application that reads
+the authentication information, such as the userid and a password.
+Arguments to LOGIN are full pathnames to each
+authentication module (if there are more than one), followed by a full
+pathname to the main application.
+.PP
+3. LOGIN reads the userid and password, then runs
+the program specified by its first argument, which is the first
+authentication module.
+The remaining arguments are passed to the new process.
+The mechanism by which the authentication information is passed to the
+authentication module is described later.
+.PP
+4. Each authentication module reads the authentication information, and
+determines if the previous authentication module succesfully processed
+the authentication request.
+If not, the module attempts to authenticate it itself.
+In any event, the module runs the next program specified by its first
+argument, and the remaining arguments are passed along to the next
+program.
+If any previous authentication module succesfully processed the
+authentication request, the next program is run immediately without
+any further processing.
+.PP
+5. Eventually, APP runs,
+APP reads the authentication information and
+determines whether any authentication module managed to succesfully
+process the authentication request.
+If so, APP runs normally.
+Otherwise, APP runs LOGIN with its
+original arguments in order to return an error message ("Password invalid",
+or something similar) and read the next authentication request.
+.PP
+Daisy-chaining authentication modules, in this fashion, makes it possible
+to have hybrid systems that use multiple authentication modules.
+Example: using authpam to authenticate system accounts,
+and authmysql to authentication virtual mailboxes without
+a corresponding system account.
+.PP
+Here's a more detailed description of the overall process:
+.SS "THE LOGIN PROCESS"
+.PP
+The LOGIN process checks if the AUTHARGC
+environment variable is set.  If not, this is the first time the
+LOGIN process comes up, and LOGIN
+displays the initial login prompt.  Additionally, the command line arguments
+to LOGIN are 
+literal copied to the AUTHARGC
+and AUTHARGVn environment variables.
+That is: the number of command line arguments is saved in
+AUTHARGC; the zeroth command line argument is saved in
+AUTHARGV0; the remaining command line arguments are saved
+in AUTHARGV1, AUTHARGV2,
+and so on.
+.PP
+After obtaining the authentication information (such as the userid and
+password), LOGIN creates a pipe, and arranges for the
+output end of the pipe to be located on file descriptor #3.
+The LOGIN process forks; the original process then
+executes the first authentication module, in the manner described earlier;
+the child process writes the authentication record to the pipe, then
+terminates.
+.PP
+The authentication record is a chunk of data in the following
+format:
+.sp
+.RS
+.PP
+\fISERVICE\fR<NEWLINE>\fIAUTHTYPE\fR<NEWLINE>\fIAUTHDATA\fR
+.RE
+.PP
+Each occurence of <NEWLINE> represents an ASCII linefeed
+character (#10).
+"SERVICE" identifies the service that originates the
+authentication request, such as "imap", or "webmail".
+Authentication module may use this identifier, or ignore it.
+.PP
+"AUTHTYPE" identifies the format of the authentication
+request.
+Everything after the second <NEWLINE> is an opaque blob
+of data, whose format is determined by AUTHTYPE\&.
+.sp
+.RS
+.B "Note:"
+There's a theoretical upper limit on the maximum size of the authentication
+record. It is high enough not to matter in most situations
+(the total number of characters allowed cannot be
+more than 8189 characters on a typical GNU/Linux system).
+.RE
+.PP
+The following AUTHTYPE formats are currently defined:
+.TP
+\fBlogin\fR
+A typical userid/password authentication request. AUTHDATA contains the following data:
+\fIuserid\fR<NEWLINE>\fIpassword\fR<NEWLINE>\&.
+.TP
+\fBcram-md5\fR
+Specifies the CRAM-MD5
+authentication request.
+AUTHDATA contains the following data:
+\fIchallenge\fR<NEWLINE>\fIresponse\fR<NEWLINE>\&.
+The "challenge" and "response" strings are
+base64-encoded.
+.TP
+\fBcram-sha1\fR
+Specifies the CRAM-SHA1
+authentication request, instead of CRAM-MD5, and uses the same format for
+AUTHDATA\&.
+.SS "THE AUTHENTICATION MODULE"
+.PP
+The first thing an authentication module does is check if the environment
+variable AUTHENTICATED is set to a non-empty string.
+If so, it means that a previous authentication module has handled the
+authentication request, so this module simply runs the next program,
+specified by the first argument to this authentication module.
+.PP
+Otherwise, the authentication module reads the authentication record from
+file descriptor #3, and determines whether it wants to try this
+authentication record.
+If not, the module creates a new pipe, arranges the output of the pipe
+to be on file descriptor #3, forks, the parent process runs the next
+authentication module, and the child process writes the authentication
+record to the pipe, then exits.
+.PP
+There are two ways to handle an authentication request:
+1) Use the AUTHARGC and AUTHARGVn
+variables to restart the entire authentication process - this is used
+in the event it is determined that the authentication request must be
+failed, or 2) run the next daisy-changed module, in the manner described
+previously, when it is determined that another authentication module can
+attempt to try to handle this request.
+.PP
+The following action occurs when
+the authentication module succesfully validates an authentication request:
+.PP
+1. The authenticated login ID is saved in the AUTHENTICATED
+environment variable.
+.PP
+2. The process's userid and groupid are reset to the corresponding
+userid and groupid of the authenticated login id, and the current directory
+is set to the process's defined home directory.
+.PP
+3. Some additional environment variables may also be initialized:
+AUTHFULLNAME - the login ID's full name;
+MAILDIR - the login ID's default maildir mailbox;
+MAILDIRQUOTA - the requested maildir quota.
+.SS "THE APPLICATION PROCESS"
+.PP
+Eventually, APP runs.
+The process closes file descriptor #3 (if it's open, and ignores the error
+if file descriptor #3 does not exist).
+If the AUTHENTICATED environment variable is set,
+it must mean that an authentication module was able to handle this
+authentication request, so APP starts up and runs normally.
+Otherwise the
+original command is reconstructed from the
+AUTHARGC and AUTHARGVn
+variables, and the initial login process runs again.
+.SS "LIBRARY FUNCTIONS"
+.PP
+This authentication library provides several convenient functions which
+can be used to quickly create a compliant login process, and its
+corresponding application.
+The login process should be structured as follows:
+.sp
+.RS
+.SS "A SAMPLE LOGIN PROCESS"
+
+.nf
+int main(int argc, char **argv)
+{
+   if (authmoduser(argc, argv, TIMEOUT, ERR_TIMEOUT))
+   {
+      /* Print initial greeting here */
+   }
+   else
+   {
+      /* Error: invalid userid/password */
+   }
+
+   /* read userid and password */
+
+   authmod(argc-1, argv+1, SERVICE, AUTHTYPE, AUTHDATA);
+}
+.fi
+.RE
+.PP
+The \fBauthmoduser\fR function takes care of copying
+the command line parameters to their corresponding environment variables,
+and checking whether or not this is the initial time this process runs,
+or if it is running again after a failed authentication process.
+TIMEOUT specifies the absolute login timeout,
+\fBauthmoduser\fR quietly terminates the process if it
+runs due to a failed authentication request and at least
+TIMEOUT seconds have elapsed since the first time
+\fBauthmoduser\fR was run.
+ERR_TIMEOUT specifies the number of seconds that
+\fBauthmoduser\fR will sleep after a failed
+authentication request.
+.PP
+The SERVICE, AUTHTYPE, and
+AUTHDATA arguments to \fBauthmod\fR
+are null-terminated character strings that form the authentication request.
+\fBauthmod\fR takes care of setting up the pipe to the
+first authentication module, and runs it.
+.PP
+The application process is even simpler:
+.sp
+.RS
+.SS "A SAMPLE APP PROCESS"
+
+.nf
+int main(int argc, char **argv)
+{
+const char *loginid=authmodclient();
+
+   /* Application begins normally */
+
+}
+.fi
+.RE
+.PP
+The \fBauthmodclient\fR function returns the authenticated
+login ID.
+If the authentication request failed, \fBauthmodclient\fR
+reruns the original login process, and doesn't return.
+.SS "INSIDE AN AUTHENTICATION MODULES"
+.PP
+An authentication module needs to define the following structure:
+.sp
+.RS
+.SS "STRUCT AUTHSTATICINFO"
+
+.nf
+struct authstaticinfo {
+        const char *auth_name;
+        char * (*auth_func)(const char *, const char *, char *, int,
+                        void (*)(struct authinfo *, void *),
+                        void *);
+        int (*auth_prefunc)(const char *, const char *,
+                        int (*)(struct authinfo *, void *),
+                        void *);
+        void (*auth_cleanupfunc)();
+        int (*auth_changepwd)(const char *, /* service */
+                              const char *, /* userid */
+                              const char *, /* oldpassword */
+                              const char *); /* new password */
+        } ;
+.fi
+.RE
+.PP
+\fBauth_func\fR points to a function that handles the
+authentication request.
+If succesful, \fBauth_func\fR is responsible for resetting
+the userid and groupid, changing to the authentication account's home
+directory, and setting up the necessary environment variables.
+The first three arguments to \fBauth_func\fR will be
+SERVICE, AUTHTYPE, and
+AUTHDATA\&.
+The next argument is a boolean flag which is non-zero if the authentication
+code is being called in the context of a stand-alone authentication module,
+or zero if the authentication code is called directly by an application.
+The fifth argument points is a callback function pointer, which
+may be NULL.
+If it's not null, \fBauth_func\fR should not reset
+the userid, groupid, or the home directory of this process, but
+should instead initialize the authinfo
+structure, which is defined as follows:
+.sp
+.RS
+.SS "STRUCT AUTHINFO"
+
+.nf
+struct authinfo {
+        const char *sysusername;
+        const uid_t *sysuserid;
+        gid_t sysgroupid;
+        const char *homedir;
+
+        const char *address;	/* The E-mail address */
+        const char *fullname;	/* gecos, etc... */
+        const char *maildir;
+        const char *quota;
+
+        const char *passwd;
+        const char *clearpasswd;        /* For authldap */
+
+        unsigned staticindex;   /* When statically-linked functions are
+                                ** called, this holds the index of the
+                                ** authentication module in authstaticlist */
+
+        } ;
+.fi
+.RE
+.PP
+The
+\fBpasswd\fR,
+\fBclearpasswd\fR, and
+\fBstaticindex\fR fields are not used by
+\fBauth_func\fR\&.
+Either \fBsysusername\fR or
+\fBsysuserid\fR must be a non-NULL pointer.
+\fBsysuserid\fR specifies an explicit userid,
+otherwise \fBsysusername\fR is looked up in the
+password file.
+.PP
+The last argument to \fBauth_func\fR is an opaque
+pointer that gets passed as the second argument to the callback
+function.
+.PP
+\fBauth_func\fR
+should return a pointer to the authenticated loginid, in dynamic memory
+(the memory should be \fBfree()\fRed after user.
+A NULL return indicates an authentication failure.
+The authentication module should set \fBerrno\fR to
+EPERM in the event that it the next authentication module
+should have a chance to process the authentication request, or use
+any other \fBerrno\fR value to immediately fail the authentication
+request, and rerun the original login process.
+.SS "LINKED AUTHENTICATION MODULES"
+.PP
+The \fBauth_prefunc\fR,
+\fBauth_cleanupfunc\fR,
+and \fBauth_changepwd\fR functions are not used by
+stand-alone modules, but when the authentication module is directly
+linked with an application.
+.PP
+\fBauth_prefunc\fR verifies that the requested userid
+exists.
+No passwords are validated, the first two arguments to
+\fBauth_prefunc\fR are the userid, and
+SERVICE\&.
+\fBauth_prefunc\fR should initialize an
+authinfo structure, and run the
+callback function, the third argument to
+\fBauth_prefunc\fR\&.
+The callback function receives the fourth argument to
+\fBauth_prefunc\fR as an opaque pointer.
+.PP
+\fBauth_prefunc\fR should come back with the callback
+function's return code, if the requested userid was found.
+Otherwise,
+\fBauth_prefunc\fR should return a non-zero integer.
+A positive integer should be return in the event that this authentication
+request should be stopped, and a negative itneger if another authentication
+module can be tried.
+An application that links against this authentication library will run
+each configured authentication module's
+\fBauth_prefunc\fR,
+until some module is able to process the requested userid, or until
+\fBauth_prefunc\fR comes back with a non-zero positive
+return code.
+.PP
+\fBauth_func\fR or
+\fBauth_prefunc\fR might allocate some internal resources,
+which should be freed by calling
+\fBauth_cleanupfunc\fR\&.
+.PP
+The \fBauth_changepwd\fR
+function is called to implement the change password functionality.
+.SS "OTHER AUTHENTICATION LIBRARY FUNCTION"
+.PP
+This authentication library contains several functions and macros that
+can be helpful in building authentication modules.
+.sp
+.RS
+.SS "TURNING AUTH_FUNC INTO A MODULE"
+
+.nf
+#define MODULE  auth_func
+#include        "mod.h"
+.fi
+.RE
+.PP
+\fImod.h\fR contains template code that reads an authentication
+request from the previous authentication module, call
+\fBauth_func\fR, in such a manner, and appropriately
+run the next module in the authentication chain.
+.PP
+The \fIauth.h\fR header file also declares several useful
+functions that authentication-related code may find convenient.

+ * Additionally, the PAM library might allocate some resources that

+\`configure' configures courier-authlib 1.0 to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
+                          [$ac_default_prefix]
+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          [PREFIX]
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.
+
+Fine tuning of the installation directories:
+  --bindir=DIR            user executables [EPREFIX/bin]
+  --sbindir=DIR           system admin executables [EPREFIX/sbin]

+
+Some influential environment variables:
+  CC          C compiler command
+  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
+  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
+              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
+  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
+  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
+              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
+  CPP         C preprocessor
+
+Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
+it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.

+                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
+
+ Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+                            Preamble
+
+  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
+software and other kinds of works.
+
+  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
+to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
+the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
+share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
+software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
+GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
+any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
+want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
+free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
+these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
+certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
+you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
+gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
+freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
+or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
+know their rights.
+
+  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
+(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
+giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
+
+  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
+that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
+authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
+changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
+authors of previous versions.
+
+  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
+modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
+can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
+protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
+pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
+use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
+have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
+products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
+stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
+of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
+
+  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
+States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
+software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
+avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
+make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
+patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+  0. Definitions.
+
+  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
+
+  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
+works, such as semiconductor masks.
+
+  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
+License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
+"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
+
+  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
+in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
+exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
+earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
+
+  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
+on the Program.
+
+  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
+permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
+infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
+computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
+distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
+public, and in some countries other activities as well.
+
+  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
+parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
+a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
+
+  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
+to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
+feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
+tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
+extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
+work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
+the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
+menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
+
+  1. Source Code.
+
+  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
+for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
+form of a work.
+
+  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
+standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
+interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
+is widely used among developers working in that language.
+
+  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
+than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
+packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
+Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
+Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
+implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
+"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
+(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
+(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
+produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
+
+  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
+the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
+work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
+control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
+System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
+programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
+which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
+includes interface definition files associated with source files for
+the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
+linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
+such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
+subprograms and other parts of the work.
+
+  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
+can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
+Source.
+
+  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
+same work.
+
+  2. Basic Permissions.
+
+  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
+copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
+conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
+permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
+covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
+content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
+rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
+
+  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
+convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
+in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
+of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
+with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
+the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
+not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
+for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
+and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
+your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
+
+  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
+the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
+makes it unnecessary.
+
+  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
+
+  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
+measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
+11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
+similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
+measures.
+
+  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
+circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
+is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
+the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
+modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
+users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
+technological measures.
+
+  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
+
+  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
+receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
+appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
+keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
+non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
+keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
+recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
+
+  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
+and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
+
+  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
+
+  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
+produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
+terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
+    it, and giving a relevant date.
+
+    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
+    released under this License and any conditions added under section
+    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
+    "keep intact all notices".
+
+    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
+    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
+    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
+    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
+    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
+    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
+    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
+
+    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
+    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
+    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
+    work need not make them do so.
+
+  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
+works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
+and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
+in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
+"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
+used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
+beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
+in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
+parts of the aggregate.
+
+  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
+
+  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
+of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
+machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
+in one of these ways:
+
+    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
+    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
+    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
+    customarily used for software interchange.
+
+    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
+    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
+    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
+    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
+    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
+    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
+    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
+    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
+    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
+    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
+    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
+
+    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
+    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
+    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
+    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
+    with subsection 6b.
+
+    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
+    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
+    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
+    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
+    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
+    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
+    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
+    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
+    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
+    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
+    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
+    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
+
+    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
+    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
+    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
+    charge under subsection 6d.
+
+  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
+from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
+included in conveying the object code work.
+
+  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
+tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
+or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
+into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
+doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
+product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
+typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
+of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
+actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
+is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
+commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
+the only significant mode of use of the product.
+
+  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
+procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
+and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
+a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
+suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
+code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
+modification has been made.
+
+  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
+specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
+part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
+User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
+fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
+Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
+by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
+if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
+modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
+been installed in ROM).
+
+  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
+requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
+for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
+the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
+network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
+adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
+protocols for communication across the network.
+
+  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
+in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
+documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
+source code form), and must require no special password or key for
+unpacking, reading or copying.
+
+  7. Additional Terms.
+
+  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
+License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
+Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
+be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
+that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
+apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
+under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
+this License without regard to the additional permissions.
+
+  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
+remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
+it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
+removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
+additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
+for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
+
+  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
+add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
+that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
+
+    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
+    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
+
+    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
+    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
+    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
+
+    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
+    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
+    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
+
+    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
+    authors of the material; or
+
+    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
+    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
+
+    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
+    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
+    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
+    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
+    those licensors and authors.
+
+  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
+restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
+received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
+governed by this License along with a term that is a further
+restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
+a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
+License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
+of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
+not survive such relicensing or conveying.
+
+  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
+must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
+additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
+where to find the applicable terms.
+
+  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
+form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
+the above requirements apply either way.
+
+  8. Termination.
+
+  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
+provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
+modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
+this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
+paragraph of section 11).
+
+  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
+license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
+provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
+finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
+holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
+prior to 60 days after the cessation.
+
+  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
+reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
+violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
+received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
+copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
+your receipt of the notice.
+
+  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
+licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
+this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
+reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
+material under section 10.
+
+  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
+
+  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
+run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
+occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
+to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
+nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
+modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
+not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
+covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
+
+  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
+
+  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
+receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
+propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
+for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
+
+  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
+organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
+organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
+work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
+transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
+licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
+give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
+Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
+the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
+
+  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
+rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
+not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
+rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
+(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
+any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
+sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
+
+  11. Patents.
+
+  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
+License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
+work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
+
+  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
+owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
+hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
+by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
+but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
+consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
+purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
+patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
+this License.
+
+  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
+patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
+make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
+propagate the contents of its contributor version.
+
+  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
+agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
+(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
+sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
+party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
+patent against the party.
+
+  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
+and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
+to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
+publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
+then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
+available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
+patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
+consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
+license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
+actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
+covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
+in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
+country that you have reason to believe are valid.
+
+  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
+arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
+covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
+receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
+or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
+you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
+work and works based on it.
+
+  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
+the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
+conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
+specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
+work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
+in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
+to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
+the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
+parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
+patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
+conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
+for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
+contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
+or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
+
+  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
+any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
+otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
+
+  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
+
+  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
+covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
+not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
+to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
+the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
+License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
+
+  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
+
+  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
+permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
+under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
+combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
+License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
+but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
+section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
+combination as such.
+
+  14. Revised Versions of this License.
+
+  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
+the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
+address new problems or concerns.
+
+  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
+Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
+Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
+option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
+version or of any later version published by the Free Software
+Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
+GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
+by the Free Software Foundation.
+
+  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
+versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
+public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
+to choose that version for the Program.
+
+  Later license versions may give you additional or different
+permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
+author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
+later version.
+
+  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
+
+  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
+APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
+HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
+OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
+THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
+IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
+ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  16. Limitation of Liability.
+
+  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
+THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
+GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
+USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
+DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
+PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
+EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
+SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
+
+  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
+above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
+reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
+an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
+Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
+copy of the Program in return for a fee.
+
+                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
+    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
+notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
+might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
+
+  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
+if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
+For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
+<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
+
+  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
+into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
+may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
+the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
+Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read

+
+IMAP_OBSOLETE_CLIENT=0
+
+##NAME: IMAP_UMASK:0
+#
+# IMAP_UMASK sets the umask of the server process.  The value of IMAP_UMASK is
+# simply passed to the "umask" command.  The default value is 022.
+#
+# This feature is mostly useful for shared folders, where the file permissions
+# of the messages may be important.
+
+IMAP_UMASK=022

+##NAME: IMAP_ULIMITD:0
+#
+# IMAP_ULIMITD sets the maximum size of the data segment of the server
+# process.  The value of IMAP_ULIMITD is simply passed to the "ulimit -d"
+# command (or ulimit -v).  The argument to ulimi sets the upper limit on the
+# size of the data segment of the server process, in kilobytes.  The default
+# value of 65536 sets a very generous limit of 64 megabytes, which should
+# be more than plenty for anyone.
+#
+# This feature is used as an additional safety check that should stop
+# any potential denial-of-service attacks that exploit any kind of
+# a memory leak to exhaust all the available memory on the server.
+# It is theoretically possible that obscenely huge folders will also
+# result in the server running out of memory when doing server-side

+##NAME: IMAP_USELOCKS:0
+#
+# Setting IMAP_USELOCKS to 1 will use dot-locking to support concurrent
+# multiple access to the same folder.  This incurs slight additional

+
+##NAME: IMAP_EMPTYTRASH:0
+#
+# The following setting is optional, and causes messages from the given
+# folder to be automatically deleted after the given number of days.
+# IMAP_EMPTYTRASH is a comma-separated list of folder:days.  The default

+# Another useful setting would be:
+#
+# IMAP_EMPTYTRASH=Trash:7,Sent:30
+#
+# This would also delete messages from the Sent folder (presumably copies
+# of sent mail) after 30 days.  This is a global setting that is applied to
+# every mail account, and is probably useful in a controlled, corporate
+# environment.
+#
+# Important: the purging is controlled by CTIME, not MTIME (the file time
+# as shown by ls).  It is perfectly ordinary to see stuff in Trash that's
+# a year old.  That's the file modification time, MTIME, that's displayed.
+# This is generally when the message was originally delivered to this
+# mailbox.  Purging is controlled by a different timestamp, CTIME, which is
+# changed when the file is moved to the Trash folder (and at other times too).

+##NAME: IMAP_MOVE_EXPUNGE_TO_TRASH:0
+#
+# Set IMAP_MOVE_EXPUNGE_TO_TRASH to move expunged messages to Trash.  This

+#
+# If OUTBOX is defined, mail can be sent via the IMAP connection by copying

+# like any other IMAP folder.  The kicker: any message copied or moved to
+# this folder is will be E-mailed by the Courier-IMAP server, by running
+# the SENDMAIL program.  Therefore, messages copied or moved to this
+# folder must be well-formed RFC-2822 messages, with the recipient list
+# specified in the To:, Cc:, and Bcc: headers.  Courier-IMAP relies on
+# SENDMAIL to read the recipient list from these headers (and delete the Bcc:
+# header) by running the command "$SENDMAIL -oi -t -f $SENDER", with the
+# message piped on standard input.  $SENDER will be the return address
+# of the message, which is set by the authentication module.

+
+Basic Installation
+==================
+
+   Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
+configure, build, and install this package.  The following
+more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
+instructions specific to this package.  Some packages provide this
+`INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features documented
+below.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not
+necessarily a bug.  More recommendations for GNU packages can be found
+in *note Makefile Conventions: (standards)Makefile Conventions.
+
+   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
+various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
+those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
+It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
+definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
+you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
+file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
+debugging `configure').
+
+   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
+and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
+the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is
+disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
+cache files.
+
+   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
+to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
+diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
+be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
+some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
+may remove or edit it.
+
+   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
+`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if
+you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version
+of `autoconf'.
+
+   The simplest way to compile this package is:
+
+  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
+     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.
+
+     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
+     some messages telling which features it is checking for.
+
+  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
+
+  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
+     the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.
+
+  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
+     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
+     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
+     user, and only the `make install' phase executed with root
+     privileges.
+
+  5. Optionally, type `make installcheck' to repeat any self-tests, but
+     this time using the binaries in their final installed location.
+     This target does not install anything.  Running this target as a
+     regular user, particularly if the prior `make install' required
+     root privileges, verifies that the installation completed
+     correctly.
+
+  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
+     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
+     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
+     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
+     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
+     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
+     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
+     with the distribution.
+
+  7. Often, you can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed
+     files again.  In practice, not all packages have tested that
+     uninstallation works correctly, even though it is required by the
+     GNU Coding Standards.
+
+  8. Some packages, particularly those that use Automake, provide `make
+     distcheck', which can by used by developers to test that all other
+     targets like `make install' and `make uninstall' work correctly.
+     This target is generally not run by end users.
+
+Compilers and Options
+=====================
+
+   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
+the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
+for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.
+
+   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
+by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
+is an example:
+
+     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix
+
+   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.
+
+Compiling For Multiple Architectures
+====================================
+
+   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
+same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
+own directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
+directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
+the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
+source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.  This
+is known as a "VPATH" build.
+
+   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
+architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
+installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
+reconfiguring for another architecture.
+
+   On MacOS X 10.5 and later systems, you can create libraries and
+executables that work on multiple system types--known as "fat" or
+"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple `-arch' options to the
+compiler but only a single `-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
+this:
+
+     ./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
+                 CXX="g++ -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
+                 CPP="gcc -E" CXXCPP="g++ -E"
+
+   This is not guaranteed to produce working output in all cases, you
+may have to build one architecture at a time and combine the results
+using the `lipo' tool if you have problems.
+
+Installation Names
+==================
+
+   By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
+`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
+can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
+`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX', where PREFIX must be an
+absolute file name.
+
+   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
+architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
+pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
+PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
+Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.
+
+   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
+options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
+kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
+you can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the
+default for these options is expressed in terms of `${prefix}', so that
+specifying just `--prefix' will affect all of the other directory
+specifications that were not explicitly provided.
+
+   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the
+correct locations to `configure'; however, many packages provide one or
+both of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the
+`make install' command line to change installation locations without
+having to reconfigure or recompile.
+
+   The first method involves providing an override variable for each
+affected directory.  For example, `make install
+prefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all
+directory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of
+`${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during `configure',
+but not in terms of `${prefix}', must each be overridden at install
+time for the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of
+makefile variable overrides for each directory variable is required by
+the GNU Coding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.
+However, some platforms have known limitations with the semantics of
+shared libraries that end up requiring recompilation when using this
+method, particularly noticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.
+
+   The second method involves providing the `DESTDIR' variable.  For
+example, `make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend
+`/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of
+`DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and
+does not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,
+it does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even
+when some directory options were not specified in terms of `${prefix}'
+at `configure' time.
+
+Optional Features
+=================
+
+   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
+with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
+option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
+
+   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
+`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
+They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
+is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
+`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
+package recognizes.
+
+   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
+find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
+you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
+`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.
+
+   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the
+execution of `make' will be.  For these packages, running `./configure
+--enable-silent-rules' sets the default to minimal output, which can be
+overridden with `make V=1'; while running `./configure
+--disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be
+overridden with `make V=0'.
+
+Particular systems
+==================
+
+   On HP-UX, the default C compiler is not ANSI C compatible.  If GNU
+CC is not installed, it is recommended to use the following options in
+order to use an ANSI C compiler:
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -Ae -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500"
+
+and if that doesn't work, install pre-built binaries of GCC for HP-UX.
+
+   On OSF/1 a.k.a. Tru64, some versions of the default C compiler cannot
+parse its `<wchar.h>' header file.  The option `-nodtk' can be used as
+a workaround.  If GNU CC is not installed, it is therefore recommended
+to try
+
+     ./configure CC="cc"
+
+and if that doesn't work, try
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -nodtk"
+
+   On Solaris, don't put `/usr/ucb' early in your `PATH'.  This
+directory contains several dysfunctional programs; working variants of
+these programs are available in `/usr/bin'.  So, if you need `/usr/ucb'
+in your `PATH', put it _after_ `/usr/bin'.
+
+   On Haiku, software installed for all users goes in `/boot/common',
+not `/usr/local'.  It is recommended to use the following options:
+
+     ./configure --prefix=/boot/common
+
+Specifying the System Type
+==========================
+
+   There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out
+automatically, but needs to determine by the type of machine the package
+will run on.  Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the
+_same_ architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
+a message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
+`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
+type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:
+
+     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
+
+where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:
+
+     OS
+     KERNEL-OS
+
+   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
+`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
+need to know the machine type.
+
+   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
+use the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will
+produce code for.
+
+   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
+platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
+"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
+eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.
+
+Sharing Defaults
+================
+
+   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
+you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
+default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
+`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
+`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
+`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
+A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.
+
+Defining Variables
+==================
+
+   Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
+environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
+configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
+variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
+them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:
+
+     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc
+
+causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
+overridden in the site shell script).
+
+Unfortunately, this technique does not work for `CONFIG_SHELL' due to
+an Autoconf bug.  Until the bug is fixed you can use this workaround:
+
+     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash /bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash
+
+`configure' Invocation
+======================
+
+   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
+operates.
+
+`--help'
+`-h'
+     Print a summary of all of the options to `configure', and exit.
+
+`--help=short'
+`--help=recursive'
+     Print a summary of the options unique to this package's
+     `configure', and exit.  The `short' variant lists options used
+     only in the top level, while the `recursive' variant lists options
+     also present in any nested packages.
+
+`--version'
+`-V'
+     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
+     script, and exit.
+
+`--cache-file=FILE'
+     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
+     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
+     disable caching.
+
+`--config-cache'
+`-C'
+     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.
+
+`--quiet'
+`--silent'
+`-q'
+     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
+     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
+     messages will still be shown).
+
+`--srcdir=DIR'
+     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
+     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.
+
+`--prefix=DIR'
+     Use DIR as the installation prefix.  *note Installation Names::
+     for more details, including other options available for fine-tuning
+     the installation locations.
+
+`--no-create'
+`-n'
+     Run the configure checks, but stop before creating any output
+     files.
+
+`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
+`configure --help' for more details.

+
+# These exist entirely to fool aclocal when bootstrapping libtool.
+#
+# In the past libtool.m4 has provided macros via AC_DEFUN (or AU_DEFUN)
+# which have later been changed to m4_define as they aren't part of the
+# exported API, or moved to Autoconf or Automake where they belong.
+#
+# The trouble is, aclocal is a bit thick.  It'll see the old AC_DEFUN
+# in /usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4 and remember it, then when it sees us
+# using a macro with the same name in our local m4/libtool.m4 it'll
+# pull the old libtool.m4 in (it doesn't see our shiny new m4_define
+# and doesn't know about Autoconf macros at all.)
+#
+# So we provide this file, which has a silly filename so it's always
+# included after everything else.  This provides aclocal with the
+# AC_DEFUNs it wants, but when m4 processes it, it doesn't do anything
+# because those macros already exist, or will be overwritten later.
+# We use AC_DEFUN over AU_DEFUN for compatibility with aclocal-1.6. 
+#
+# Anytime we withdraw an AC_DEFUN or AU_DEFUN, remember to add it here.
+# Yes, that means every name once taken will need to remain here until
+# we give up compatibility with versions before 1.7, at which point
+# we need to keep only those names which we still refer to.
+
+# This is to help aclocal find these macros, as it can't see m4_define.

+                            Courier-IMAP version 4.0
+
+   Contents of this NEWS file:
+
+     Introduction
+     Shared folders and access control lists
+
+  Introduction
+
+   Courier-IMAP 4.0 brings many changes and improvements. All
+   authentication-related code in Courier-IMAP has been moved into the
+   external Courier Authentication Library. See the contents of the INSTALL
+   file for more information. Courier-IMAP now includes an IMAP/POP3
+   aggregation proxy, like Perdition. See the "imap/README.proxy" file in the
+   source distribution for more information. Mail accounts can be distributed
+   across a pool of servers. A separate server (or another pool of servers)
+   accept connections from IMAP and POP3 clients, waits for the client's
+   login request, looks the mail account's server, and connects to the
+   IMAP/POP3 server on the right host, with the IMAP/POP3 client being no
+   wiser. Any kind of an upper limit on the scalability of the IMAP/POP3
+   server, or how large of a mail store it can support, has been eliminated.
+   The only limit to Courier-IMAP's horizontal scaling is the available
+   bandwidth on the LAN.
+
+  Shared folders and access control lists
+
+   New to Courier-IMAP 3 are the ACL (access control list) IMAP extension,
+   and ACL-based virtual shared folders. Courier-IMAP 3 implements both the
+   existing ACL specification, RFC 2086, as well as an experimental
+   implementation of the second draft revision of the ACL specification.
+   Virtual shared folders is a different implementation of shared folders
+   that supplements an older implementation in Courier-IMAP 2, and earlier.
+   The older, POSIX permission-based shared folders are still implemented and
+   supported. Here's a summary of the differences between the two shared
+   folder mechanisms:
+
+      POSIX-based shared folders              ACL shared folders
+                                  May be used with virtual accounts only;
+     May be used with system      cannot be used on systems that have
+     accounts only^1              end-user login shell access: bypassing ACLs
+                                  and accessing the folders directly is
+                                  trivial
+     Access rights based on       Access rights based on IMAP access control
+     traditional POSIX filesystem lists
+     permissions
+     Sharable folders must be set A site-specific process must be installed
+     up manually, using the       to compile an index of all virtual
+     "maildirmake" command        mailboxes; afterwords, individual users may
+                                  create and manage shared folders themselves
+
+       ^1 This is because access rights are governed by filesystem
+       permissions. POSIX shared folders may also be used with virtual
+       accounts, but it will not be possible to grant read-only access to
+       shared folders, and everyone will be able to delete messages from
+       shared folders (instead of only the creator of each message)
+
+   After installation, read the "maildiracl" manual page for a brief overview
+   of access control lists.
+
+   Read "maildir/README.sharedfolders.html" for information on configuring
+   virtual shared folders

+	** sysgroupid - REQUIRED - gid_t, the group ID of the user.
+	**
+	** homedir - REQUIRED - home directory.
+	**
+	** address - REQUIRED - the 'identity' of the authenticated user,
+	**                      the e-mail address.  It is acceptable to set
+	**                      this field also to userid, if you can't think
+	**                      of anything better to do.
+	**
+	** fullname - OPTIONAL - user's full name.
+	**
+	** maildir - OPTIONAL - user's primary maildir ($HOME/Maildir default)
+	**
+	** quota - OPTIONAL - user's maildir quota (see a README somewhere)
+	**
+	** passwd, clearpasswd - one of these fields must be initialized,
+	**                       either one is ok.  Initialize clearpasswd
+	**                       if you store cleartext passwords.  If you

+
+   Courier-IMAP is a fast, scalable, enterprise IMAP server that uses
+   Maildirs. Many E-mail service providers use Courier-IMAP to easy handle
+   hundreds of thousands of mail accounts. With its built-in IMAP and POP3
+   aggregation proxy, Courier-IMAP has practically infinite horizontal
+   scalability. In a proxy configuration, a pool of Courier servers service
+   initial IMAP and POP3 connections from clients. They wait to receive the
+   client's log in request, look up the server that actually holds this mail
+   account's mailbox, and establish a proxy connection to the server, all in
+   a single, seamless process. Mail accounts can be moved between different
+   servers, to achieve optimum resource usage.
+
+   The only practical limitation on Courier-IMAP is available network and I/O
+   bandwidth. If you are new to Courier-IMAP, this may sound a bit
+   intimidating. But you do not need to tackle everything at once. Start by
+   taking small, easy steps. Your first step will be to set up a small
+   Courier-IMAP server, using it like any other traditional IMAP service, on
+   a single server. After you gain experience and become comfortable with
+   Courier, you can then begin exploring its advanced features.
+
+   This is the same IMAP server that's included in the Courier mail server,
+   but configured as a standalone IMAP server that can be used with other
+   mail servers - such as Qmail, Exim, or Postfix - that deliver to maildirs.
+   If you already have Courier installed, you do not need to download this
+   version. If you install this version, you must remove it if you later
+   install the entire Courier server.
+
+   The following pages provide additional background and supporting
+   documentation. You can jump anytime to the download page using the top
+   menu bar.

-# These exist entirely to fool aclocal when bootstrapping libtool.
-#
-# In the past libtool.m4 has provided macros via AC_DEFUN (or AU_DEFUN)
-# which have later been changed to m4_define as they aren't part of the
-# exported API, or moved to Autoconf or Automake where they belong.
-#
-# The trouble is, aclocal is a bit thick.  It'll see the old AC_DEFUN
-# in /usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4 and remember it, then when it sees us
-# using a macro with the same name in our local m4/libtool.m4 it'll
-# pull the old libtool.m4 in (it doesn't see our shiny new m4_define
-# and doesn't know about Autoconf macros at all.)
-#
-# So we provide this file, which has a silly filename so it's always
-# included after everything else.  This provides aclocal with the
-# AC_DEFUNs it wants, but when m4 processes it, it doesn't do anything
-# because those macros already exist, or will be overwritten later.
-# We use AC_DEFUN over AU_DEFUN for compatibility with aclocal-1.6. 
-#

-# IMAP_ULIMITD sets the maximum size of the data segment of the server
-# process.  The value of IMAP_ULIMITD is simply passed to the "ulimit -d"
-# command (or ulimit -v).  The argument to ulimi sets the upper limit on the
-# size of the data segment of the server process, in kilobytes.  The default
-# value of 65536 sets a very generous limit of 64 megabytes, which should
-# be more than plenty for anyone.
-#
-# This feature is used as an additional safety check that should stop
-# any potential denial-of-service attacks that exploit any kind of
-# a memory leak to exhaust all the available memory on the server.
-# It is theoretically possible that obscenely huge folders will also
-# result in the server running out of memory when doing server-side
-# sorting (by my calculations you have to have at least 100,000 messages
-# in a single folder, for that to happen).
-
-IMAP_ULIMITD=65536
-
-##NAME: IMAP_USELOCKS:0
-#
-# Setting IMAP_USELOCKS to 1 will use dot-locking to support concurrent
-# multiple access to the same folder.  This incurs slight additional
-# overhead.  Concurrent multiple access will still work without this setting,
-# however occasionally a minor race condition may result in an IMAP client
-# downloading the same message twice, or a keyword update will fail.
-#
-# IMAP_USELOCKS=1 is strongly recommended when shared folders are used.
-
-IMAP_USELOCKS=1
-
-##NAME: IMAP_SHAREDINDEXFILE:0
-#
-# The index of all accessible folders.  Do not change this setting unless
-# you know what you're doing.  See README.sharedfolders for additional
-# information.
-
-IMAP_SHAREDINDEXFILE=@sysconfdir@/shared/index
-
-##NAME: IMAP_ENHANCEDIDLE:0
-#
-# If Courier was compiled with the File Alteration Monitor, setting
-# IMAP_ENHANCEDIDLE to 1 enables enhanced IDLE mode, where multiple
-# clients may open the same folder concurrently, and receive updates to
-# folder contents in realtime.  See the imapd(8) man page for additional
-# information.
-#
-# IMPORTANT: IMAP_USELOCKS *MUST* also be set to 1, and IDLE must be included
-# in the IMAP_CAPABILITY list.
-#
-
-IMAP_ENHANCEDIDLE=0
-
-##NAME: IMAP_TRASHFOLDERNAME:0
-#
-# The name of the magic trash Folder.  For MSOE compatibility,
-# you can set IMAP_TRASHFOLDERNAME="Deleted Items".
-#
-# IMPORTANT:  If you change this, you must also change IMAP_EMPTYTRASH
-
-IMAP_TRASHFOLDERNAME=Trash
-
-##NAME: IMAP_EMPTYTRASH:0
-#
-# The following setting is optional, and causes messages from the given
-# folder to be automatically deleted after the given number of days.
-# IMAP_EMPTYTRASH is a comma-separated list of folder:days.  The default
-# setting, below, purges 7 day old messages from the Trash folder.
-# Another useful setting would be:
-#
-# IMAP_EMPTYTRASH=Trash:7,Sent:30
-#
-# This would also delete messages from the Sent folder (presumably copies
-# of sent mail) after 30 days.  This is a global setting that is applied to
-# every mail account, and is probably useful in a controlled, corporate
-# environment.
-#
-# Important: the purging is controlled by CTIME, not MTIME (the file time
-# as shown by ls).  It is perfectly ordinary to see stuff in Trash that's
-# a year old.  That's the file modification time, MTIME, that's displayed.
-# This is generally when the message was originally delivered to this
-# mailbox.  Purging is controlled by a different timestamp, CTIME, which is
-# changed when the file is moved to the Trash folder (and at other times too).
-#
-# You might want to disable this setting in certain situations - it results
-# in a stat() of every file in each folder, at login and logout.
-#
-
-IMAP_EMPTYTRASH=Trash:7
-
-##NAME: IMAP_MOVE_EXPUNGE_TO_TRASH:0
-#
-# Set IMAP_MOVE_EXPUNGE_TO_TRASH to move expunged messages to Trash.  This
-# effectively allows an undo of message deletion by fishing the deleted
-# mail from trash.  Trash can be manually expunged as usually, and mail
-# will get automatically expunged from Trash according to IMAP_EMPTYTRASH.
-#
-# NOTE: shared folders are still expunged as usual.  Shared folders are
-# not affected.
-#
-
-IMAP_MOVE_EXPUNGE_TO_TRASH=0
-
-
-##NAME: OUTBOX:0
-#
-# The next set of options deal with the "Outbox" enhancement.
-# Uncomment the following setting to create a special folder, named
-# INBOX.Outbox
-#
-# OUTBOX=.Outbox
-
-##NAME: SENDMAIL:0
-#
-# If OUTBOX is defined, mail can be sent via the IMAP connection by copying
-# a message to the INBOX.Outbox folder.  For all practical matters,
-# INBOX.Outbox looks and behaves just like any other IMAP folder.  If this
-# folder doesn't exist it must be created by the IMAP mail client, just
-# like any other IMAP folder.  The kicker: any message copied or moved to
-# this folder is will be E-mailed by the Courier-IMAP server, by running
-# the SENDMAIL program.  Therefore, messages copied or moved to this
-# folder must be well-formed RFC-2822 messages, with the recipient list
-# specified in the To:, Cc:, and Bcc: headers.  Courier-IMAP relies on
-# SENDMAIL to read the recipient list from these headers (and delete the Bcc:
-# header) by running the command "$SENDMAIL -oi -t -f $SENDER", with the
-# message piped on standard input.  $SENDER will be the return address
-# of the message, which is set by the authentication module.
-#
-# DO NOT MODIFY SENDMAIL, below, unless you know what you're doing.
-#
-
-SENDMAIL=@SENDMAIL@
-
-##NAME: HEADERFROM:0
-#
-# For administrative and oversight purposes, the return address, $SENDER
-# will also be saved in the X-IMAP-Sender mail header.  This header gets
-# added to the sent E-mail (but it doesn't get saved in the copy of the
-# message that's saved in the folder)
-#
-# WARNING - By enabling OUTBOX above, *every* IMAP mail client will receive
-# the magic OUTBOX treatment.  Therefore advance LARTing is in order for
-# _all_ of your lusers, until every one of them is aware of this.  Otherwise if
-# OUTBOX is left at its default setting - a folder name that might be used
-# accidentally - some people may be in for a rude surprise.  You can redefine
-# the name of the magic folder by changing OUTBOX, above.  You should do that
-# and pick a less-obvious name.  Perhaps brand it with your organizational
-# name ( OUTBOX=.WidgetsAndSonsOutbox )
-
-HEADERFROM=X-IMAP-Sender
-
-##NAME: OUTBOX_MULTIPLE_SEND:0
-#
-# Remove the following comment to allow a COPY of more than one message to
-# the Outbox, at a time.
-#
-# OUTBOX_MULTIPLE_SEND=1
-
-##NAME: IMAPDSTART:0
-#
-# IMAPDSTART is not used directly.  Rather, this is a convenient flag to
-# be read by your system startup script in /etc/rc.d, like this:
-#
-#  . @sysconfdir@/imapd
-#

-# The default setting is going to be NO, so you'll have to manually flip
-# it to yes.

-#  This configuration file sets various options for the Courier-IMAP server
-#  when used to handle SSL IMAP connections.
-#
-#  SSL and non-SSL connections are handled by a dedicated instance of the
-#  couriertcpd daemon.  If you are accepting both SSL and non-SSL IMAP
-#  connections, you will start two instances of couriertcpd, one on the
-#  IMAP port 143, and another one on the IMAP-SSL port 993.
-#
-#  Download OpenSSL from http://www.openssl.org/
-#
-##NAME: SSLPORT:1
-#
-#  Options in the imapd-ssl configuration file AUGMENT the options in the
-#  imapd configuration file.  First the imapd configuration file is read,
-#  then the imapd-ssl configuration file, so we do not have to redefine
-#  anything.
-#
-#  However, some things do have to be redefined.  The port number is
-#  specified by SSLPORT, instead of PORT.  The default port is port 993.
-#
-#  Multiple port numbers can be separated by commas.  When multiple port
-#  numbers are used it is possibly to select a specific IP address for a
-#  given port as "ip.port".  For example, "127.0.0.1.900,192.168.0.1.900"
-#  accepts connections on port 900 on IP addresses 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.0.1
-#  The SSLADDRESS setting is a default for ports that do not have
-#  a specified IP address.
-

-# GnuTLS only:
-#
-# Set the minimum number of acceptable bits for a DH key exchange.
-#
-# GnuTLS's compiled-in default is 727 bits (as of GnuTLS 1.6.3). Some server
-# have been encountered that offer 512 bit keys. You may have to set
-# TLS_MIN_DH_BITS=512 here, if necessary.
-
-##NAME: TLS_KX_LIST:0
-#
-# GnuTLS only:
-#
-# Allowed key exchange protocols. The default of "ALL" should be sufficient.
-# The list of supported key exchange protocols depends on the options GnuTLS
-# was compiled against, but may include the following:
-#
-# DHERSA, DHEDSS, RSA, SRP, SRPRSA, SRPDSS, PSK, DHEPSK, ANONDH, RSAEXPORT
-
-TLS_KX_LIST=ALL
-
-##NAME: TLS_COMPRESSION:0
-#
-# GnuTLS only:
-#
-# Optional compression. "ALL" selects all available compression methods.
-#
-# Available compression methods: DEFLATE, LZO, NULL
-
-TLS_COMPRESSION=ALL
-
-##NAME: TLS_CERTS:0
-#
-# GnuTLS only:
-#
-# Supported certificate types are X509 and OPENPGP.
-#
-# OPENPGP has not been tested
-
-TLS_CERTS=X509
-
-##NAME: TLS_TIMEOUT:0
-# TLS_TIMEOUT is currently not implemented, and reserved for future use.
-# This is supposed to be an inactivity timeout, but its not yet implemented.
-#
-
-##NAME: TLS_DHCERTFILE:0
-#
-# TLS_DHCERTFILE - PEM file that stores a Diffie-Hellman -based certificate.
-# When OpenSSL is compiled to use Diffie-Hellman ciphers instead of RSA
-# you must generate a DH pair that will be used.  In most situations the
-# DH pair is to be treated as confidential, and the file specified by
-# TLS_DHCERTFILE must not be world-readable.
-#
-# TLS_DHCERTFILE=
-
-##NAME: TLS_CERTFILE:0
-#
-# TLS_CERTFILE - certificate to use.  TLS_CERTFILE is required for SSL/TLS
-# servers, and is optional for SSL/TLS clients.  TLS_CERTFILE is usually
-# treated as confidential, and must not be world-readable. Set TLS_CERTFILE
-# instead of TLS_DHCERTFILE if this is a garden-variety certificate
-#
-# VIRTUAL HOSTS (servers only):
-#
-# Due to technical limitations in the original SSL/TLS protocol, a dedicated
-# IP address is required for each virtual host certificate. If you have
-# multiple certificates, install each certificate file as
-# $TLS_CERTFILE.aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd, where "aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd" is the IP address
-# for the certificate's domain name. So, if TLS_CERTFILE is set to
-# /etc/certificate.pem, then you'll need to install the actual certificate
-# files as /etc/certificate.pem.192.168.0.2, /etc/certificate.pem.192.168.0.3
-# and so on, for each IP address.
-#
-# GnuTLS only (servers only):
-#
-# GnuTLS implements a new TLS extension that eliminates the need to have a
-# dedicated IP address for each SSL/TLS domain name. Install each certificate
-# as $TLS_CERTFILE.domain, so if TLS_CERTFILE is set to /etc/certificate.pem,
-# then you'll need to install the actual certificate files as
-# /etc/certificate.pem.host1.example.com, /etc/certificate.pem.host2.example.com
-# and so on.
-#
-# Note that this TLS extension also requires a corresponding support in the
-# client. Older SSL/TLS clients may not support this feature.
-#
-# This is an experimental feature.
-
-TLS_CERTFILE=@certsdir@/imapd.pem
-
-##NAME: TLS_TRUSTCERTS:0
-#
-# TLS_TRUSTCERTS=pathname - load trusted certificates from pathname.
-# pathname can be a file or a directory. If a file, the file should
-# contain a list of trusted certificates, in PEM format. If a
-# directory, the directory should contain the trusted certificates,
-# in PEM format, one per file and hashed using OpenSSL's c_rehash
-# script. TLS_TRUSTCERTS is used by SSL/TLS clients (by specifying
-# the -domain option) and by SSL/TLS servers (TLS_VERIFYPEER is set
-# to PEER or REQUIREPEER).
-#
-
-TLS_TRUSTCERTS=@cacerts@
-
-##NAME: TLS_VERIFYPEER:0
-#
-# TLS_VERIFYPEER - how to verify client certificates.  The possible values of
-# this setting are:
-#
-# NONE - do not verify anything
-#
-# PEER - verify the client certificate, if one's presented
-#
-# REQUIREPEER - require a client certificate, fail if one's not presented
-#
-#
-TLS_VERIFYPEER=NONE
-
-
-##NAME: TLS_EXTERNAL:0
-#
-# To enable SSL certificate-based authentication:
-#
-# 1) TLS_TRUSTCERTS must be set to a pathname that holds your certificate
-#    authority's SSL certificate
-#
-# 2) TLS_VERIFYPEER=PEER or TLS_VERIFYPEER=REQUIREPEER (the later settings
-#    requires all SSL clients to present a certificate, and rejects
-#    SSL/TLS connections without a valid cert).
-#
-# 3) Set TLS_EXTERNAL, below, to the subject field that holds the login ID.
-#    Example:
-#
-#  TLS_EXTERNAL=emailaddress
-#
-# The above example retrieves the login ID from the "emailaddress" subject
-# field. The certificate's emailaddress subject must match exactly the login
-# ID in the courier-authlib database.
-
-##NAME: TLS_CACHE:0
-#
-# A TLS/SSL session cache may slightly improve response for IMAP clients
-# that open multiple SSL sessions to the server.  TLS_CACHEFILE will be
-# automatically created, TLS_CACHESIZE bytes long, and used as a cache
-# buffer.
-#
-# This is an experimental feature and should be disabled if it causes
-# problems with SSL clients.  Disable SSL caching by commenting out the
-# following settings:
-
-TLS_CACHEFILE=@localstatedir@/couriersslcache
-TLS_CACHESIZE=524288
-
-##NAME: MAILDIRPATH:0
-#
-# MAILDIRPATH - directory name of the maildir directory.
-#
-MAILDIRPATH=Maildir

+
+# These exist entirely to fool aclocal when bootstrapping libtool.
+#
+# In the past libtool.m4 has provided macros via AC_DEFUN (or AU_DEFUN)
+# which have later been changed to m4_define as they aren't part of the
+# exported API, or moved to Autoconf or Automake where they belong.
+#
+# The trouble is, aclocal is a bit thick.  It'll see the old AC_DEFUN
+# in /usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4 and remember it, then when it sees us
+# using a macro with the same name in our local m4/libtool.m4 it'll
+# pull the old libtool.m4 in (it doesn't see our shiny new m4_define
+# and doesn't know about Autoconf macros at all.)
+#
+# So we provide this file, which has a silly filename so it's always
+# included after everything else.  This provides aclocal with the
+# AC_DEFUNs it wants, but when m4 processes it, it doesn't do anything
+# because those macros already exist, or will be overwritten later.
+# We use AC_DEFUN over AU_DEFUN for compatibility with aclocal-1.6. 
+#
+# Anytime we withdraw an AC_DEFUN or AU_DEFUN, remember to add it here.
+# Yes, that means every name once taken will need to remain here until
+# we give up compatibility with versions before 1.7, at which point
+# we need to keep only those names which we still refer to.
+
+# This is to help aclocal find these macros, as it can't see m4_define.

-# pop3d-ssl created from pop3d-ssl.dist by sysconftool
-#
-# Do not alter lines that begin with ##, they are used when upgrading
-# this configuration.
-#
-#  Copyright 2000-2008 Double Precision, Inc.  See COPYING for
-#  distribution information.
-#
-#  This configuration file sets various options for the Courier-IMAP server
-#  when used to handle SSL POP3 connections.
-#
-#  SSL and non-SSL connections are handled by a dedicated instance of the
-#  couriertcpd daemon.  If you are accepting both SSL and non-SSL POP3
-#  connections, you will start two instances of couriertcpd, one on the
-#  POP3 port 110, and another one on the POP3-SSL port 995.
-#
-#  Download OpenSSL from http://www.openssl.org/
-#
-##NAME: SSLPORT:0
-#
-#  Options in the pop3d-ssl configuration file AUGMENT the options in the
-#  pop3d configuration file.  First the pop3d configuration file is read,
-#  then the pop3d-ssl configuration file, so we do not have to redefine
-#  anything.
-#
-#  However, some things do have to be redefined.  The port number is
-#  specified by SSLPORT, instead of PORT.  The default port is port 995.
-#
-#  Multiple port numbers can be separated by commas.  When multiple port
-#  numbers are used it is possibly to select a specific IP address for a
-#  given port as "ip.port".  For example, "127.0.0.1.900,192.168.0.1.900"
-#  accepts connections on port 900 on IP addresses 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.0.1
-#  The SSLADDRESS setting is a default for ports that do not have
-#  a specified IP address.
-
-SSLPORT=995
-
-##NAME: SSLADDRESS:0
-#
-#  Address to listen on, can be set to a single IP address.
-#
-# SSLADDRESS=127.0.0.1

-#
-# WARNING: Peer certificate verification has NOT yet been tested.  Proceed
-# at your own risk.  Only the basic SSL/TLS functionality is known to be
-# working. Keep this in mind as you play with the following variables.
-
-COURIERTLS=@bindir@/couriertls
-
-##NAME: TLS_PROTOCOL:0
-# 
-# TLS_PROTOCOL sets the protocol version.  The possible versions are:
-#
-# OpenSSL:
-#
-# SSL3 - SSLv3
-# SSL23 - either SSLv2 or SSLv3 (also TLS1, it seems)
-# TLS1 - TLS1
-#
-# Note that this setting, with OpenSSL, is modified by the TLS_CIPHER_LIST
-# setting, below.
-#
-# GnuTLS:
-#
-# SSL3   - SSLv3
-# TLS1   - TLS 1.0
-# TLS1_1 - TLS 1.1
-#
-# When compiled against GnuTLS, multiple protocols can be selected as follows:
-#
-# TLS_PROTOCOL="TLS1_1:TLS1:SSL3"
-#
-# DEFAULT VALUES:
-#
-# SSL23 (OpenSSL), or "TLS_1:TLS1:SSL3" (GnuTLS)
-
-##NAME: TLS_STARTTLS_PROTOCOL:0
-# 
-# TLS_STARTTLS_PROTOCOL is used instead of TLS_PROTOCOL for the POP3 STARTTLS
-# extension, as opposed to POP3 over SSL on port 995.
-#
-# It takes the same values for OpenSSL/GnuTLS as TLS_PROTOCOL
-
-TLS_STARTTLS_PROTOCOL=TLS1
-
-##NAME: TLS_CIPHER_LIST:0
-#
-# TLS_CIPHER_LIST optionally sets the list of ciphers to be used by the
-# OpenSSL library.  In most situations you can leave TLS_CIPHER_LIST
-# undefined
-#
-# OpenSSL:
-#
-# TLS_CIPHER_LIST="SSLv3:TLSv1:HIGH:!LOW:!MEDIUM:!EXP:!NULL:!aNULL@STRENGTH"
-#
-#
-# GnuTLS:
-#
-# TLS_CIPHER_LIST="HIGH:MEDIUM"
-#
-# The actual list of available ciphers depend on the options GnuTLS was
-# compiled against. The possible ciphers are:
-#
-# AES256, 3DES, AES128, ARC128, ARC40, RC2, DES, NULL
-#
-# Also, the following aliases:
-#
-# HIGH -- all ciphers that use more than a 128 bit key size
-# MEDIUM -- all ciphers that use a 128 bit key size
-# LOW -- all ciphers that use fewer than a 128 bit key size, the NULL cipher
-#        is not included
-# ALL -- all ciphers except the NULL cipher
-
-
-##NAME: TLS_MIN_DH_BITS:0
-#
-# TLS_MIN_DH_BITS=n
-#
-# GnuTLS only:
-#
-# Set the minimum number of acceptable bits for a DH key exchange.
-#
-# GnuTLS's compiled-in default is 727 bits (as of GnuTLS 1.6.3). Some server
-# have been encountered that offer 512 bit keys. You may have to set
-# TLS_MIN_DH_BITS=512 here, if necessary.
-
-##NAME: TLS_KX_LIST:0
-#
-# GnuTLS only:
-#
-# Allowed key exchange protocols. The default of "ALL" should be sufficient.
-# The list of supported key exchange protocols depends on the options GnuTLS
-# was compiled against, but may include the following:
-#
-# DHERSA, DHEDSS, RSA, SRP, SRPRSA, SRPDSS, PSK, DHEPSK, ANONDH, RSAEXPORT
-
-TLS_KX_LIST=ALL
-
-##NAME: TLS_COMPRESSION:0
-#
-# GnuTLS only:
-#
-# Optional compression. "ALL" selects all available compression methods.
-#
-# Available compression methods: DEFLATE, LZO, NULL
-
-TLS_COMPRESSION=ALL
-
-##NAME: TLS_CERTS:0
-#
-# GnuTLS only:
-#
-# Supported certificate types are X509 and OPENPGP.
-#
-# OPENPGP has not been tested
-
-TLS_CERTS=X509
-
-##NAME: TLS_TIMEOUT:0
-# TLS_TIMEOUT is currently not implemented, and reserved for future use.
-# This is supposed to be an inactivity timeout, but its not yet implemented.
-#
-
-##NAME: TLS_DHCERTFILE:0
-#
-# TLS_DHCERTFILE - PEM file that stores a Diffie-Hellman -based certificate.
-# When OpenSSL is compiled to use Diffie-Hellman ciphers instead of RSA
-# you must generate a DH pair that will be used.  In most situations the
-# DH pair is to be treated as confidential, and the file specified by
-# TLS_DHCERTFILE must not be world-readable.
-#
-# TLS_DHCERTFILE=
-
-##NAME: TLS_CERTFILE:0
-#
-# TLS_CERTFILE - certificate to use.  TLS_CERTFILE is required for SSL/TLS
-# servers, and is optional for SSL/TLS clients.  TLS_CERTFILE is usually
-# treated as confidential, and must not be world-readable. Set TLS_CERTFILE
-# instead of TLS_DHCERTFILE if this is a garden-variety certificate
-#
-# VIRTUAL HOSTS (servers only):
-#
-# Due to technical limitations in the original SSL/TLS protocol, a dedicated
-# IP address is required for each virtual host certificate. If you have
-# multiple certificates, install each certificate file as
-# $TLS_CERTFILE.aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd, where "aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd" is the IP address
-# for the certificate's domain name. So, if TLS_CERTFILE is set to
-# /etc/certificate.pem, then you'll need to install the actual certificate
-# files as /etc/certificate.pem.192.168.0.2, /etc/certificate.pem.192.168.0.3
-# and so on, for each IP address.
-#
-# GnuTLS only (servers only):
-#
-# GnuTLS implements a new TLS extension that eliminates the need to have a
-# dedicated IP address for each SSL/TLS domain name. Install each certificate
-# as $TLS_CERTFILE.domain, so if TLS_CERTFILE is set to /etc/certificate.pem,
-# then you'll need to install the actual certificate files as
-# /etc/certificate.pem.host1.example.com, /etc/certificate.pem.host2.example.com
-# and so on.
-#
-# Note that this TLS extension also requires a corresponding support in the
-# client. Older SSL/TLS clients may not support this feature.
-#
-# This is an experimental feature.
-
-TLS_CERTFILE=@certsdir@/pop3d.pem
-
-##NAME: TLS_TRUSTCERTS:0
-#
-# TLS_TRUSTCERTS=pathname - load trusted certificates from pathname.
-# pathname can be a file or a directory. If a file, the file should
-# contain a list of trusted certificates, in PEM format. If a
-# directory, the directory should contain the trusted certificates,
-# in PEM format, one per file and hashed using OpenSSL's c_rehash
-# script. TLS_TRUSTCERTS is used by SSL/TLS clients (by specifying
-# the -domain option) and by SSL/TLS servers (TLS_VERIFYPEER is set
-# to PEER or REQUIREPEER).
-#
-
-TLS_TRUSTCERTS=@cacerts@
-
-##NAME: TLS_VERIFYPEER:0
-#
-# TLS_VERIFYPEER - how to verify client certificates.  The possible values of
-# this setting are:
-#
-# NONE - do not verify anything
-#
-# PEER - verify the client certificate, if one's presented
-#
-# REQUIREPEER - require a client certificate, fail if one's not presented
-#
-#
-TLS_VERIFYPEER=NONE
-
-##NAME: TLS_EXTERNAL:0
-#
-# To enable SSL certificate-based authentication:
-#
-# 1) TLS_TRUSTCERTS must be set to a pathname that holds your certificate
-#    authority's SSL certificate
-#
-# 2) TLS_VERIFYPEER=PEER or TLS_VERIFYPEER=REQUIREPEER (the later settings
-#    requires all SSL clients to present a certificate, and rejects
-#    SSL/TLS connections without a valid cert).
-#
-# 3) Set TLS_EXTERNAL, below, to the subject field that holds the login ID.
-#    Example:
-#
-#  TLS_EXTERNAL=emailaddress
-#
-# The above example retrieves the login ID from the "emailaddress" subject
-# field. The certificate's emailaddress subject must match exactly the login
-# ID in the courier-authlib database.
-
-##NAME: TLS_CACHE:0
-#
-# A TLS/SSL session cache may slightly improve response for long-running
-# POP3 clients. TLS_CACHEFILE will be automatically created, TLS_CACHESIZE
-# bytes long, and used as a cache buffer.
-#
-# This is an experimental feature and should be disabled if it causes
-# problems with SSL clients.  Disable SSL caching by commenting out the
-# following settings:
-
-TLS_CACHEFILE=@localstatedir@/couriersslcache
-TLS_CACHESIZE=524288
-
-##NAME: MAILDIRPATH:0
-#
-# MAILDIRPATH - directory name of the maildir directory.
-#
-MAILDIRPATH=Maildir
