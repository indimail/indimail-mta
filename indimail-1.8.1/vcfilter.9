.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBvcfilter\fR is a utility for creating, modifying, deleting IndiMail's powerful filter
called as vfilter. There are two options; one for administration of filters and another for
administration of mailing lists subscribed by the user. For mailing lists special action needs
to be performed by \fBvfilter\fR, so that valid mails do not get rejected. Currently, 
\fBvcfilter\fR
allows maximum of 255 filters to be created.

The first form of usage is primarily for creating filters (though some amount of mailing list
updation is also possible). The second form of usage is for mailing list updation only.

\fBvcfilter\fR has the setuid bit set to root and must be run as root or domain user
