	- When adding a mailing list, automatically subscribe the
	  list owner and make them a moderator/remote admin. [892489]

	  for more flexibility and to allow new format for vacation.
	- configure.in: Compile with all warnings on.
	- Add header files: alias.h auth.h autorespond.h cgi.h command.h 
	  dotqmail.h forward.h limits.h mailinglist.h show.h template.h

1.2.4 - released 15-Nov-04

	Tom Collins
	- Modify contrib/alias2forward.pl to work with '/Maildir' or
	  '/.maildir' directory names.
	- Add #define to qmailadmin.h for globally setting Maildir directory
	  name (defaults to "/Maildir" but Gentoo can use ".maildir").
	- Better detect .qmail-alias files that are tied to mailing lists.
	  (Aliases that end in "-owner" but aren't tied to ezmlm lists 
	  will now display properly.)
	- Add printh.c, new routines for generating HTML-safe and CGI-safe
	  strings.
	- Convert sprintf calls to snprintf to avoid buffer overflow.
	- Changes to almost all .c and .html files to make use of printh
	  routines.  QmailAdmin should now properly handle email addresses
	  that contain special characters (like '+' and '&'), including
	  domain admin addresses.  It now also escapes user-supplied text
	  to avoid possible HTML-insertion and cross site scripting attacks.

1.2.3 - released 7-Oct-04

	Ken Jones
	- Remove check for C++ compiler in configure.in.

	Tom Collins
	- Before considering an alias/forward to be a 'blackhole', make
	  sure it's only a single line.
	- Ignore .qmail-alias files if 'alias' ends in '-owner'.  We assume
	  it's for a mailing list and isn't an alias.  Note that this only
	  affects systems that don't store aliases in the valias table and
	  reverts to pre-1.2.2 behavior. [992132]
	- Fix error handling when attempting to set catchall (if
	  vauth_getpw() failed, we'd end up with an empty .qmail-default).

1.2.2 - released 25-Jun-04

	Oden Eriksson
	- Added "lazy snap to" javascripts to have the cursor jump to the
	  most interesting input field. The idea was stolen from Mr. Sam's
	  sqwebmail package. [897088]

	Zhao Xin
	- Add Traditional Chinese (zh-cn) translation.	

	Tom Collins
	- Allow user to create a 'blackhole' address by entering "#" as 
	  the forwarding address when creating a new alias.
	- Display forwards even if they're all blackholes. [941083]
	- Fixed bug where unrecognized .qmail-alias entries could throw
	  QmailAdmin into an infinite loop (Modify Alias). [941082]
	- Display non-ezmlm aliases with "-owner" in the name.
	- Display aliases with "-default" in the name.
	- Use "# delete" instead of "|/bin/true delete" for blackholed
	  accounts.
	- Remove --enable-true-path from configure (no longer used).

1.2.1 - released 10-Feb-04

	Tom Collins
	- Add note to INSTALL about requiring vpopmail 5.4.0 or later.
	- Store aliases and autoresponders in valias table if vpopmail was
	  compiled with --enable-valias.  Development of this feature was
	  sponsored by ACIS Pty Ltd <http://www.acis.com.au/>. [774819]
	* If you are upgrading from a previous version of QmailAdmin and
	  used the --enable-valias option when building vpopmail, be sure
	  to download vpopmail 5.4.1 or later and use the dotqmail2valias
	  program to convert .qmail-alias files to valias table entries.

1.2.0 - released 28-Jan-04

	Tom Collins
	- Changes to Makefile to avoid copying CVS directories on install.
	  Fixes previous attempt that wasn't compatible with all platforms.
	- Update all mentions of --with-htmllibdir to --enable-htmllibdir.

1.2.0-rc2 - released 1-Jan-04

	Tom Collins
	- Added comment and added minor fix to ##z macro in template.c.

	  parameters to hook program, update documentation). [855707]
	- Use VPOPMAIL_UMASK instead of hardcoded 0077.
	- Better lstat() error messages in template.c.

1.0.29 - released 20-Nov-03

	Tom Collins
	- Totally fix enable-htmllibdir option in configure.in. [812535]
	- Change from seteuid()/setegid() to setuid()/setgid(). [834008,
	  830695].  This code only gets executed if the cgi is suid root.
	  Note that we can use these calls since we don't need to get
	  root privileges back at any point.

	- Updated configure.in for readability.
	- Moved language files from 'html' to 'lang' directory.  Note
	  that QMAILADMIN_TEMPLATEDIR and HTMLLIBDIR should point to
	  /usr/local/share/qmailadmin (or equivalent) instead of the
	  html directory in that directory.  Updated configure.in and
	  Makefile.am to reflect that change.
	- When creating user, blank quota will now use default quota.
	  Use "NOQUOTA" for unlimited. [787716] [802662]

1.0.25 - released 24-Jul-03

	******* Corrected security flaw introduced in 1.0.13 ********
	In QmailAdmin 1.0.13 through 1.0.24, it was possible for any
	user to configure their account (on the "Modify User" screen)
	to forward their email to any program on the server.

	Since the program would run as the vpopmail user, this was a
	very bad thing.  The 1.0.25 release corrects this problem,
	but will remove existing program delivery lines (other than
	autoresponder and spam command) from a user's .qmail file if
	they click the "Modify User" button on the "Modify User" screen.

	This is a temporary fix; we plan to improve the code that
	alters a user's .qmail file to allow existing program delivery
	lines to remain unchanged.
	*************************************************************

	Tom Collins
	+ Security fix described above.
	+ Remove count_aliases() and CurAliases (now that aliases are
	  considered forwards).
	+ Fix count_forwards() to correctly ignore ezmlm-idx list files
	  and count all forwards (both email address and Maildir format).
	  [772529]
	+ When reading email address of list owner, strip leading & if 
	  present.
	+ Added alias2forward.pl in contrib directory to convert from
	  Maildir-style aliases to address-based forwards.  See contrib/
	  README.alias2forward for more details. [753683]
	+ Added --disable-mysql option to configure to disable MySQL 
	  options on add/modify mailing list (defaults to enabled).
	  Added ##tm tag (currently unused) to show block when MySQL
	  is enabled. [771726]
	+ Increase size of alias_user in alias.c to MAX_BUFF to avoid
	  buffer overflow on long lines in .qmail-user files. [776976]

	Nicolas Croiset
	+ Corrections to French translation.

	Andreas Tolfsen
	+ Updated Norwegian translation.

	Omer Faruk Sen
	+ Updated Turkish translation.

	Franz Stancl
	+ Added 6 missing German translations.

1.0.24 - released 16-Jul-03

	Michael Bowe
	+ Remove reference to "Aliases" in del_forward.html. [770008]

	Yuu Andou
	+ updated Japanese translation

	Tom Collins
	+ Converted tabs to spaces in .html files to make editing easier.
	+ Fixed mailinglist.c to work with non-idx build of ezmlm again.
	  [765760]
	+ Cleaned up ezmlm_make in mailinglist.c.  Limit SQL options to 64
	  characters each to prevent buffer overflow in args to ezmlm-make.
	+ Changes to mod_user.html to make it more readable and easier to
	  follow, especially with non-English translations. [762368]
	+ Configure process searches for 'true' binary in /bin, /usr/bin
	  and /usr/local/bin.  Added -enable-true-bin option to override.
	  (QmailAdmin uses 'true' for blackhole accounts until vpopmail
	  supports "#" in .qmail accounts.) [766572]
	+ Various changes to configure.in (displays more information in
	  "current settings" at end of configure process).
	+ Removed add_alias.html, del_alias_confirm.html, & show_alias.html
        + Change display of forwards for program delivery ("|") and
	  blackhole/delete ("#").  Now displays in italics, shows "deleted"
	  for blackhole and program name (without path) including command-
	  line parameters for program delivery. [771390]
	+ Cleanup Makefile.am to fix make dist and make distcheck.

1.0.23 - released 25-Jun-03

	Tom Collins
	+ Fixed get_html_text (broken during fgets cleanup).
	+ Fixed minor bug in get_catchall (user.c).

1.0.22 - released 25-Jun-03

	Tom Collins
	+ Fixed permissions on language files. [754268]
	+ Cleaned up code that determines whether user can delete an account.
	+ Converted unnecessary use of strncmp to strcmp in command.c.
	+ snprintf, GetValue, memset, fgets, strncmp, strncpy cleanup
	  [755708]
	+ Removed unneccessary memset calls before GetValue calls. [755708]
	+ Modify Makefile.am to chmod -R 755 /usr/local/share/qmailadmin
	  on install.  Also, don't create en-us language file.
	+ Cleanup in show_login_help.html.
	+ Changed qmailadmin URL in template.c to SourceForge.
	+ Cleaned up login .png files to fix bottom edge.
	+ Merged show_login_help.html and show_login.html with ##th tag.
	+ Modified install procedure in configure.in (set permissions,
	  remove login_help code, other fixes).
	+ Now uses /bin/true instead of ~vpopmail/bin/vdelivermail on
	  "blackhole" accounts (modifies James Raftery's patch in 1.0.19).

	  WARNING: Blackhole accounts set up in previous versions of
	  qmailadmin can cause infinite mail loops.  Please fix any
	  accounts using the blackhole feature by replacing the call to
	  vdelivermail with "|/bin/true delete".  To find such accounts,
	  run:
		grep vdelivermail `find ~vpopmail/domains -name .qmail`

	  Manually edit the .qmail files, or run qmailadmin 1.0.22,
	  modify the account, and click the "Modify User" button to
	  switch it to /bin/true from vdelivermail.

	Michael Bowe
	+ Cleaned up status response when adding a new forward. [753694]
	+ Minor changes to column headers on add/mod/show forward. [753694]

1.0.21 - released 06-Jun-03   

	Michael Bowe
	+ Show number used and maxmimums for autoresponders, forwards
	  and mailing lists.

	Ryan O'Neill
	+ Don't show mailing list options if configured with
	  --disable-ezmlmdir or --enable-ezmlmdir=no.

	Tom Collins
	+ Don't show mailing lists on "Add Email account" page
          if ezmlm is disabled (see above) or there aren't any lists.
	+ Change header formatting to be consistent, including Michael
          Bowe's changes.
	+ Established SourceForge project 'qmailadmin' to coordinate
	  development efforts.

	Oden Eriksson
	+ updated Swedish translation

	Jeremiah (JT) Tieman
	+ updated Spanish translation

	Maurice Snellen

	Forwards/Aliases:
	+ Was not actually checking for existing users when adding a new
	  forward
	+ Removed alias count checks, just checking for forward counts
	+ Remove AliasType code
	+ adddotqmailnow and moddotqmailnow have some shared code in a new 
	  function, adddotqmail_shared() 
	+ Changed the modify forward page to have a better table layout
	+ Changed modify forward page to show same interface as add forward;
	  less confusion
	+ Adding a forward to a local user now checks for an actual account
	  or an existing forward
	+ Listing forwards removes local domain if a local user.  If the
	  local user does not exist (actual or forward), it lists the
	  user@domain in red to jump out as an invalid forward 
	  (compares domain part of alias (after @) for an exact match
	  with the Domain logged into)
	+ Some changes to html/en to better reflect when dealing with forwards
	+ Delete user now uses the shared code of adddotqmail_shared()

	Quota:
	+ For administrator, Quota field populates on mod user.
	+ For user, Quota is displayed on mod user.

	Session values:
	+ Modified the .qw file to hold a string of variable value
	  combinations that GetValue() can read.  (eg,
	  "ip_addr=[ip]&another_var=[whatever]", etc)
	+ Added two session values that may be a little specific to me: 
	  returntext and returnhttp.  These values, when both are given,
	  will replace the Logout text with the text in returntext, and
	  the link for logout to the link in returnhttp.  I am going to
	  be working on a very simple SquirrelMail plugin that will send
	  the user to qmailadmin, and I wanted a easy way to  let them
	  return to squirrelmail instead of logging out.

	Catchall:
	+ Catchall continues to use the Maildir for local users, but if
	  the file contains a local email address, the qmailadmin UI will 
	  show that account as the catchall.
     
	Login page changes:
	+ Added configuration option --enable-domain-autofill (default no)
	  to fill the domain based on the accessed domain (compares the 
	  HTTP_HOST to the virtualdomains to get the correct domain)
	+ If username and dom are set in the var line (as they are when
	  logging out), those fill the username and domain
	+ If username is not filled, defaults to postmaster (as it used to)
	+ If a failed login attempt is made, the username and domain are
	  filled the same as they were when the login attempt was made

	Spam Detection:
	+ Added --enable-modify-spam configuration directive to turn on
	  this option (default OFF)
	+ Added --enable-spam-command to define the command to be used
	  in the users .qmail file (default: "|preline /usr/local/bin/maildrop 
	  /etc/mailfilter")
	+ Updated INSTALL (for spam instruction and domain autofill
	  instruction)
	+ Add user page now has the option to set spam detection
	+ When Save Copy AND detect spam are checked, spam is detected
	  on local (only)

	General cleanup:
	+ Added a new, special tag in the templates: ##tX where X is a letter.  
	  This tag could help clean some of the templates up:  It allows 
	  optional output in the templates.
	+ Added 3 tags for ##t:  ##tq is for MODIFY_QUOTA, ##ta for
	   DOMAIN_ADMIN, ##tu for USER_ADMIN
	+ Merged mod_user_*.html to mod_user.html using ##tq tag
	+ Merged add_user_*.html to add_user.html using ##tq tag
	+ Removed "Email Accounts" and "Main Menu" links from USER_ADMIN
	  mod_user page. (because they are not necessary, there's no more
	  functionality for a user on the main menu or the "Email Accounts"
	  listing)
	+ Fixed configuration files so autoconf, automake, etc. work.
	+ Updated TODO (removed the stuff this fixes or is outdated)

1.0.20
05/26/03    Tom Collins
          - Fix bug when enabling MySQL support on mailing list.

05/26/03    Tom Collins
          - Removed references to --enable-maxpopusers, etc. from

1.0.18
05/21/03    James Raftery
          - User Flags on Modify User pages are now commented out in the
            HTML by default.

            Tom Collins
          - Added common sorting code for Mail Robots, Mailing Lists,
            and List Subscribers.

1.0.17
04/28/03    Tom Collins
          - updated menus in page footers to include Logout link, and a link
            up to the previous level of the menu tree.

          - qmailadmin now tries the primary language (e.g., de) if there
            isn't a file for the sublanguage (e.g., de-at). [787707]

1.0.16
04/18/03    Tom Collins
          - when regular users log in they go directly to the modify user page
        
          - Clean up error reporting when changing a user's password.  
            The verror should only be reported if the change failed,
            instead of when it works, and there's no need to display the 
            email address -- it's right there on the modify user page.

          - On the list of mailing lists page, it will only show 
            digest-related buttons for a list if it has a digest.

            Franz Stancl
          - New German translation

03/03/03    Fabio Erri
          - New Italian translation

02/27/03    Joshua Megerman
          - more robust handling of .qmail file syntax. Lines like:
            |/usr/local/bin/maildrop ./.mailfilter would be mangled into 
            two lines:
            &|/usr/local/bin/maildrop
            &./.mailfilter
            This patch correctly handles the above case and is backwardly 
            compatible

1.0.12
02/27/03    Tom Collins
          - *Major* overhaul of add/modify mailing list code and interface.
          - New entries to en lanuage file for mailing list interface

            Ken Jones
          - update all language files to include English text for the
            new mailing list entries.

1.0.11
02/26/03    Dorneles Tremea
          - Removed files 'Makefile.in.orig' and 'Makefile.in.rej'
          - Added item 260 to enable 'Routing' translation, on both
            'mod user noquota.html' and 'mod user quota.html' files.
          - Updated Brazilian Portuguese translation file.

            Ken Jones
          - new --enable-imagedir=[dir] configure option to control what
            directory to place the image files in. 
            Default is DocumentRoot/images/qmailadmin

          - new --enable-imageurl=url configure option to control the URL
            to access the images.
            Default is http://machine/images/qmailadmin

1.0.10
02/25/03    Tom Collins
          - Replace the generic red buttons used everywhere with special
            buttons for "delete" and "modify".
   
          - Replace the buttons in the user list for setting the CatchAll
            account with a set of radio buttons.  This is a slight improvement,
            but could use more work, specifically in how remote and bounce 
            CatchAll are displayed.
   
          - Move delete and modify buttons to the left side of row information,
            especially in rows of varying length that are left align.
            Note that trash.png is a modified version of an icon from KDE and
            modify.png is an icon from GAIM (both GPL products, so re-use of
            icons should be OK).

          - add Users Guide, Admin Guide and Help Index into language files

1.0.9
01/25.03    Oden Eriksson
          - Remove un-used code, show_locals(), show_rcpthosts(), 
            show_virtualdomains(), show_assign(). These functions
            were a start at making qmailadmin be able to administer
            qmail control files. Instead of putting them in qmailadmin,
            they were moved to the vqadmin package.

            Ken Jones
          - add dependencies in Makefile.am so all files get recompiled
            if configure is run again. All .o files depend on config.h
          - --enable-help wasn't correctly setting up the show_login.html page


01/24/03  - Makefile.am had 8 spaces instead of a tab 

            Brian Kolaci
          - make qmailadmin posix complient
            remove the fts_ functions

1.0.8
01/21/03  - on Modify Mailing list page with idx installed, Should display
            prefix and not Quota.

            Oden Eriksson, Deserve IT com
          - 1.0.8 Swedish Translation.
            Svenskar bör korrekturläsa denna och/eller ge synpunkter.

          - solved the alphasort problem by just using strcasecmp
            function for two dir entry parameters. Wonder if scandir
            is supported on HP/Solaris/BSD?

01/19/03  - New help links from www dot cfes dot ca

1.0.7
01/18/03  - moduser  logic syntax for displaying quota modification or
            not was not using the correct file names. There are only two
            file names, mod_user_quota.html and mod_user_noquota.html.
            Everyone gets noquota except when configured with 
            --enable-modify-quota=y AND the user (usually postmaster)
            who has
             if(AdminType==DOMAIN_ADMIN)send_template("mod_user_quota.html");

1.0.7
01/14/03    Michael Bowe mbowe at pipeline dot com dot au
          - Make the menu layout more consistent with other parts
            of qmailadmin. ie put the email address on the left and
            the action button on the right 
          - In the show subscribers menu, the column headings were
            the reverse of the data. ie the action button was in the
            address column, and the address was in the action column.
          - Add mailing list screen showed Quota instead of Prefix, 
            added line to language files
          - Show accounts screen displayed Total/Moderators instead 
            of Total Accounts. Added line to language files

          - Clean up of MODIFY_QUOTA #ifdefs

            setting --enable-user-modify-quota=y will allow the postmaster
            or other site admin account to set a users quota.
          - new dependency rules in Makefile.am to remake all the files
            if config.h changes (re-run config and make will recompile all
            the code, otherwise, it might not pick up the changes)


01/10/03    Michael Bowe mbowe at pipeline dot com dot au
          - configure script contains a typo for the maxaliasesperpage
            configure command
          - page navigation hyperlinks at the bottom of show forwards/aliases
            screen always display "next page" even when there are no more
            users to display

            being able to "save and forward" or to set a vacation,
            respectively.

01/09/03
          - update login code to use a GET to login like:
            https://host/cgi-bin/qmailadmin?username=postmaster&
            domain=yourdomain&password=your_postmaster_password

          - fixes soft links when a mailing list is changed. Now the
            softlinks can get unlinked successfully.

          - cleaned up indentation

03/22/02  - add --enable-ipauth=yes (default). If you have clients behind
            a NAT/proxie/whatever who's IP address changes during the 
            session then you need to use --enable-ipauth=no

03/18/02  - cleaned up ChangeLog 

            Antoni Nata tonix at interazioni dot it
          - updated Italian translation

03/15/02  - typo in en file "New Mailing Lists" should be "New Mailing List"

03/14/02    Tom Collins tom at tomlogic dot com
          - use malloc to allocate 64k blocks of memory for reading in address
            list instead of a large block of fixed length strings
          - more efficient use of memory -- doesn't allocate 96 bytes for 
            each address
          - will read addresses up to 255 characters long
          - will handle up to 100,000 addresses as long as they fit in
            200*65536 bytes of memory (note that a web browser would probably
            crash before displaying that many addresses)
          - case-insensitive sort of email addresses
          - uses qsort instead of the bubble(?) sort in v1.0.2 (should be
            significantly faster for large mailing lists)
          - removed spacestring and checked2.
          - combined a lot of the functions that worked with
            subscribers/moderators with a single function that could handle
            either.  It eliminates a lot of duplicate code, and ensures that a
            change to one happens to the other.
          - As a result,  fixed a bug or two in how qmailadmin behaved.  
            For example, it looks like entering a bad address on the 
            "add moderator" form would display the error on the 
            "add subscriber" form.
          - also made some changes per a post by Chris Hardie 
            (11:13 AM -0500 2/28/02):

            Yeak Nai Siew yeak at md dot com dot my
          - clean up of mod_user to support forwarding AND vacation.
          - clean up form field returned by template.c so the \n character
            is not part of the field data. 

03/12/02  - use malloc instead of stack space for large character arrays
          - mailinglist.c: make sublist and pa arrays globals instead of
            allocating space on the stack
          - change sublist and pa arrays to char not unsigned char
          - util.c: check_local_user stating for username not needed.
          - new --enable-user-index option. Disable display of user indexes
            in case using Internet Explorer 5.50 which is brain dead. 
          - mailinglist.c: remove non-portable C++ style comments //

02/11/02  - Do not allow the language variable to be used to look at
            other files on the machine.
          - Do not allow the PATH_INFO varilable be used to look at
            other files on the machine.
