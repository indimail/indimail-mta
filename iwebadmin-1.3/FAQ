ANSWERS

1. How do I use the QMAILADMIN_TEMPLATEDIR variable with 
   apache so that each virtual domain can have it's own set
   of html templates?

Answer: In your httpd.conf file, inside each virtualhost section..

<VirtualHost XXX>
 ...
SetEnv QMAILADMIN_TEMPLATEDIR /usr/local/share/qmailadmin/xxx
 ...
</VirtualHost>

Inside of the template dir you must place all the html template
files as well as the translation files.

2. How do I display the version of qmailadmin in the templates?

Answer: Put the hook "##V" in the desired html location.

3. What are html/header.html and html/footer.html for?

Answer: Each time qmailadmin sends an html file, it first sends header.html, 
then the template file, and then footer.html.  By default, the initial html
common to all html templates is in header.html.  Like wise, the ending html
common to all templates is in footer.html.  If you want unique header/footer
information in the template files, you can move this from of header.html and
footer.html information back into each template file.  But leave header.html
and footer.html empty, as deleting them will generate an error.

4. How do I include other files in the templates?

Answer:  Use the hook ##N<filename># to include non-template files.  There are 
a few restrictions in doing this:

    1. The file must be in the HTMLLIBDIR, or a subdirectory thereof.
    2. The filename cannot start with a "/".
    3. The filename cannot include "../".

5. Since upgrading to vpopmail-5.0, not all of my users show up anymore, 
   or I get the message "No users left to view, please return to the 
   previous page" when trying to view POP Accounts.

Answer: This is most likeley caused by recompiling vpopmail-5.0 with clear 
password support using the cdb authentication module (default).  Domains that
were created *before* recompiling do not have the clear password field in the
vpasswd file.  Any users created *after* upgrading do not have this problem.
This field can be created by running:

vmoduser -C "" <user@doamin>

for each user in each domain.  There is a simple bash script in the contrib
directory called addclearfield-cdb.sh that will automate this task for you.
***Make sure you backup your password files before running this script, as it
is not supported.  Read comments at the top of the script for more info.
