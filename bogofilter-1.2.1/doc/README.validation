The bogofilter package will validate its SGML/XML documents prior to building
either derived versions or the distribution tarball.

The names of required packages differ greatly among the various distributions,
some don't ship with the needed packages at all.

Here's what packages are needed (assuming all their dependencies are installed
as well according to the respective packager's directions):

Mandrake Linux 9.1:
  HTML: OpenSP or  openjade, HTML document type definitions installed manually
  XML:  docbook-dtd412-xml, libxml2, libxml2-utils

SuSE Linux 8.2:
  HTML: opensp, html-dtd
  XML:  libxml2, libxslt, docbook_4, xmlto (needs to be installed manually)

FreeBSD:
  HTML: jade or openjade, html
  XML:  xmlto

If you encounter a slew of errors, it may be necessary to create a
catalog file.  The following line will create the needed file for a
Mandrake system (with html-4.01.tar.gz installed in /usr/share/sgml/html/):

    echo 'CATALOG "/usr/share/sgml/html/catalog"' > catalog
