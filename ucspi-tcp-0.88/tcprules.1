.TH tcprules 1
.SH NAME
tcprules \- compiles rules for
.BR tcpserver (1).
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tcprules
.I cdb
.I tmp

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR tcpserver (1)
optionally follows rules to decide whether a TCP connection is acceptable.

.SH "IPv4 ADDRESSES"
For example, the rule 
.IP
18.23.0.32:deny
.P
prohibits connections from IP address 18.23.0.32.
Ranges of IPv4 addresses can defined in a \fIclass-dependend\fR manner
.IP
18.:deny
.P 
or by means of a range of contiguous addresses
.IP
18.23.0.1-22:ins
.P
Rather a CIDR notation can be used instead. The rule
.IP
127.0/8:allow
.P
accepts any connections from the loopback net.

The bit-lenth of the given IP address has
at least to match number of net-prefix bits. 
Otherwise, a syntax error is displayed.

\fINote\fR: Always IP addresses with the longest matching prefix
are considered.

.SH "IPv6 ADDRESSES"
.B tcprules
understands \fIcompactified\fR IPv6 addresses in standard
CIDR notation.
The rule
.IP
2001:de01:2:3:4:a:b:c:deny 
.P
rejects any IPv6 packet from a single host while 
.IP
2002::/48:deny
.P
can be used to block an entire IPv6 (sub-)net
in case the net-prefix (here: \fI/48\fR) is provided.

\fINote\fR: Since the IPv6 address on input is evaluated
in it's compactified format, simply include the final '::'
for convenience. The resulting address is truncated 
to the number of provided prefix bits. 

.SH "IPv6 MAPPED IPv4 ADDRESSES"
.B tcprules
does currently not understand IPv6 mapped IPv4 addresses
.IP
::ffff:a.b.c.d
.P
where 
.IP
a.b.c.d
.P 
is the mapped IPv4 addresses.

.B tcprules
reads rules from its standard input and writes them into
.I cdb
in a binary format suited for quick access by
.BR tcpserver (1).

.B tcprules
can be used while
.BR tcpserver (1)
is running. It ensures that
.I cdb
is updated atomically. It does this by first writing the rules to
.I tmp
and then moving
.I tmp
on top of
.IR cdb .
If
.I tmp
already exists, it is destroyed. The directories containing
.I cdb
and
.I tmp
must be writable to
.BR tcprules ;
they must also be on the same filesystem. 

If there is a problem with the input or with
.IR tmp ,
.B tcprules
complains and leaves
.I cdb
alone. 

The binary
.I cdb
format is portable across machines.

.SH RULE FORMAT
A rule is one line. A file containing rules may also contain comments: lines
beginning with # are ignored. 

Each rule contains an address, a colon, and a list of instructions, with no
extra spaces. When
.BR tcpserver (1)
receives a connection from that address, it follows the instructions.
.SH ADDRESSES
.BR tcpserver (1)
looks for rules with various addresses: 
.IP 1.
$TCPREMOTEINFO@$TCPREMOTEIP, if $TCPREMOTEINFO is set; 
.IP 2.
$TCPREMOTEINFO@=$TCPREMOTEHOST, if $TCPREMOTEINFO is set and $TCPREMOTEHOST is
set;
.IP 3.
$TCPREMOTEIP; 
.IP 4.
=$TCPREMOTEHOST, if $TCPREMOTEHOST is set; 
.IP 5.
shorter and shorter prefixes of $TCPREMOTEIP ending with a dot; 
.IP 6.
shorter and shorter suffixes of $TCPREMOTEHOST starting with a dot, preceded
by =, if $TCPREMOTEHOST is set; 
.IP 7.
=, if $TCPREMOTEHOST is set; and finally 
.IP 8.
the empty string. 
.P
.BR tcpserver (1)
uses the first rule it finds. You should use the
.B -p
option to
.BR tcpserver (1)
if you rely on $TCPREMOTEHOST here. 

For example, here are some rules: 

     joe@127.0.0.1:first
     18.23.0.32:second
     :third
     127.:fourth

If $TCPREMOTEIP is 10.119.75.38,
.BR tcpserver (1)
will follow the third instructions. 

If $TCPREMOTEIP is 18.23.0.32,
.BR tcpserver (1)
will follow the second instructions. 

If $TCPREMOTEIP is 127.0.0.1 and $TCPREMOTEINFO is bill,
.BR tcpserver (1)
will follow the fourth instructions. 

If $TCPREMOTEIP is 127.0.0.1 and $TCPREMOTEINFO is joe,
.BR tcpserver (1)
will follow the first instructions. 

.IP \[bu] 2
Compact IPv6 host addresses in the format:

.EX
fe80::a:b:cd:1234
.EE

.IP \[bu]
Classless IPv4/IPv6 net addresses declared in the common CIDR /prefix notation:

.EX
127.0/8:allow
fe80::/64:allow
.EE

Note: You have to declare (implicitly) that many address bytes as required by the prefix.
Longer addresses are automatically truncated.

.IP \[bu]
Evaluation of the CIDR addresses considers the longest matching prefix. Thus, you can
specify:

.EX
2001:a::/48:deny
2001:a:b:c::/64:allow
.EE

You can use
.BR tcprulescheck (1)
to see how tcpserver will interpret rules in
.IR cdb .

.SH ADDRESS RANGES
.B tcprules
treats 1.2.3.37-53:ins as an abbreviation for the rules 1.2.3.37:ins,
1.2.3.38:ins, and so on up through 1.2.3.53:ins. Similarly, 10.2-3.:ins is an
abbreviation for 10.2.:ins and 10.3.:ins.

.SH CIDR Notation
.B tcprules
understands CIDR notation. The rule

.EX
127.0/8:allow
.EE

accepts any connections from the loopback net.
Note: Always IP addresses with the longest matching prefix are considered.

.SH IPv6 ADDRESSES
\fBtcprules\fR understands compact IPv6 addresses in standard CIDR notation. The rule

.EX
2001:de01:2:3:4:a:b:c:deny
.EE

rejects any IPv6 packet from a single host while

.EX
2002::/48:deny
.EE

can be used to block an entire IPv6 (sub-)net, in case the net-prefix (here: /48) is
provided.
Note: Since the IPv6 address on input is evaluated in it's compacted format, simply
include the final '::' for convenience. The resulting address is truncated to the number
of provided prefix bits.

.SH INSTRUCTIONS
The instructions in a rule must begin with either allow or deny. deny tells
.BR tcpserver (1)
to drop the connection without running anything. For example, the rule
.IP
:deny
.P
tells
.BR tcpserver (1)
to drop all connections that aren't handled by more specific rules. 

The instructions may continue with some environment variables, in the form
var="x".
.BR tcpserver (1)
adds an environment variable $var with value x. For example,
.IP
10.0.:allow,RELAYCLIENT="@fix.me"
.P
adds an environment variable $RELAYCLIENT with value @fix.me. The quotes may
be replaced by any repeated character:
.IP
10.0.:allow,RELAYCLIENT=/@fix.me/
.P
Any number of variables may be listed:
.IP
 127.0.0.1:allow,RELAYCLIENT="",TCPLOCALHOST="movie.edu"
 ::1:allow,RELAYCLIENT="",TCPLOCALHOST="movie.edu"
