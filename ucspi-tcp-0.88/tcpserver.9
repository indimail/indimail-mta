.TH tcpserver 1
.SH NAME
tcpserver \- accepts incoming TCP connections.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tcpserver
[
.I opts
]
.I host
.I port
.I prog
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I opts
is a series of getopt-style options.
.I host
is one argument.
.I port
is one argument.
.I prog
consists of one or more arguments. 

.B tcpserver
waits for connections from TCP clients. For each connection, it runs
.IR prog ,
with descriptor 0 reading from the network and descriptor 1 writing to the
network. It also sets up several environment variables.

The server's address is given by
.I host
and
.IR port .
.I port
may be a name from /etc/services or a number; if it is 0,
.B tcpserver
will choose a free TCP port.
.I host
may be 0, allowing connections to any local IP address; or a dotted-decimal IP
address, allowing connections only to that address; or a host name, allowing
connections to the first IP address for that host. Host names are fed through
qualification using dns_ip4_qualify (dns_ip6_qualify for ipv6).

\fBtcpserver\fR dumps on standard error, list of active connections, when it
receives SIGUSR1. \fBtcpserver\fR exits when it receives SIGTERM.

.SH OPTIONS
.B General options:
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet. Do not print error messages. 
.TP
.B \-Q
(Default.) Print error messages. 
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose. Print error messages and status messages. 
.TP
.B \-V
Verbose. Print error messages, status messages and IP connection table. 
.P
.B Connection options:
.TP
.B \-c \fIn
|
.B \fIfile

Do not handle more than
.I n
simultaneous connections. If there are
.I n
simultaneous copies of prog running, defer acceptance of a new connection
until one copy finishes.
.I n
must be a positive integer. Default: 40. In the second form, 
.I file
can be a full path to a filename containing an integer specifying
.IR n .
This file will be reread when
.B tcpserver
receives SIGHUP.

.TP
.B \-C \fIn
Do not handle more than
.I n
simultaneous connections from a particular host. If there are
.I n
simultaneous copies of prog running, defer acceptance of a new connection
until one copy finishes.
.I n
must be a positive integer. Default: 20. This can be also handled by
having the environment variable MAXPERIP compiled in the
.I rules
cdb database. The MAXPERIP environment variables gives
.B tcpserver
the ability to have different per host concurrency limit for each and every
host that is defined in the rules database.
.TP
.B \-x \fIcdb
Follow the rules compiled into
.I cdb
by
.BR tcprules (1).
These rules may specify setting environment variables or rejecting connections
from bad sources. You can rerun
.BR tcprules (1)
to change the rules while
.B tcpserver
is running. 
.TP
.B \-X
With
.B -x \fIcdb,
allow connections even if
.I cdb
does not exist. Normally
.B tcpserver
will drop the connection if
.I cdb
does not exist.

.TP
.B \-m \fIdb.conf
Follow rules specified in the MySQL table tcprules. This table has 4 columns. The column
.I iprules
contains an IP address which can include wildcards. eg. 202.144.*.?, 202.144.10-20.1, etc. The column
.I decision
can have the value
.I 'D'
to deny connections for matching IP addresses. The column
.I env
contains a list of comma separated environment variables. e.g HOME=/tmp,SERVER=galaxy.
The db.conf file has the following layout

database server ip:database user:database password:database name:table name

with this option,
.I tcpserver
will connect to the
.B MySQL(1)
server specified by parameters in db.conf file. The connect timeout can be controlled by the environment variable
.BR MYSQL_TIMEOUT .

.TP
.B \-B \fIbanner
Write
.I banner
to the network immediately after each connection is made.
.B tcpserver
writes
.I banner
before looking up $TCPREMOTEHOST, before looking up $TCPREMOTEINFO, and before
checking
.IR cdb .
This feature can be used to reduce latency in protocols where the client waits
for a greeting from the server. 
.TP
.B \-g \fIgid
Switch group ID to
.I gid
after preparing to receive connections.
.I gid
must be a positive integer. 
.TP
.B \-u \fIuid
Switch user ID to
.I uid
after preparing to receive connections.
.I uid
must be a positive integer. 
.TP
.B \-U
Same as
.B \-g
$GID
.B \-u
$UID. Typically $GID and $UID are set by
.BR envuidgid (8).
.TP
.B \-1
After preparing to receive connections, print the local port number to
standard output. 
.TP
.B \-4
Fall back to IPv4 sockets.  This is necessary for terminally broken
systems like OpenBSD which will not let IPv6 sockets connect to
V4-mapped IPv6 addresses.  Please note that this also applies to DNS
lookups, so you will have to use an DNS resolver with an IPv6 address to
accept IPv6 connections.  Use \fBDNSCACHEIP\fR to set the DNS resolver
IP dynamically.
.TP
.B \-6
Force IPv6 mode in UCSPI environment variables, even for
IPv4 connections.  This will set \fB$PROTO\fR to \fBTCP6\fR and put
IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses in \fBTCPLOCALIP\fR and \fBTCPREMOTEIP\fR.
.TP
.B \-I\fIinterface
Bind to the network interface
.I interface
("eth0" on Linux, for example).  This is only defined and needed for
IPv6 link-local addresses.
.TP
.B \-b \fIn
Allow a backlog of approximately
\I n
TCP SYNs. On some systems,
\I n
is silently limited to 5. On systems supporting SYN cookies, the backlog is
irrelevant. 
.TP
.B \-o
Leave IP options alone. If the client is sending packets along an IP source
route, send packets back along the same route.
.TP
.B \-O
(Default.) Kill IP options. A client can still use source routing to connect
and to send data, but packets will be sent back along the default route.
.TP
.B \-d
Delay sending data for a fraction of a second whenever the remote host is
responding slowly. This is currently the default, but it may not be in the
future; if you want it, set it explicitly. 
.TP
.B \-D
Never delay sending data; enable TCP_NODELAY. 
.P
.B Data-gathering options: 
.TP
.B \-h
(Default.) Look up the remote host name in DNS to set the environment variable
$TCPREMOTEHOST. 
.TP
.B \-H
Do not look up the remote host name in DNS; remove the environment variable
$TCPREMOTEHOST. To avoid loops, you must use this option for servers on TCP
port 53. 
.TP
.B \-p
Paranoid. After looking up the remote host name in DNS, look up the IP
addresses in DNS for that host name, and remove the environment variable
$TCPREMOTEHOST if none of the addresses match the client's IP address.
.TP
.B \-P
(Default.) Not paranoid. 
.TP
.B \-l \fIlocalname
Do not look up the local host name in DNS; use
.I localname
for the environment variable $TCPLOCALHOST. A common choice for
.I localname
is 0. To avoid loops, you must use this option for servers on TCP port 53. 
.TP
.B \-r
(Default.) Attempt to obtain $TCPREMOTEINFO from the remote host. 
.TP
.B  \-R
Do not attempt to obtain $TCPREMOTEINFO from the remote host. To avoid loops,
you must use this option for servers on TCP ports 53 and 113.
.TP
.B \-t \fIn
Give up on the $TCPREMOTEINFO connection attempt after
.I n
seconds. Default: 26.
.TP
.B \-n \fIcertfile
Instead of the default servercert.pem certificate use the specified
.IR certfile .

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B SSL_CIPHER
Specifies the ciphers that should be used in SSL/TLS mode. See
.I openssl(1)
for more information.
.TP
.B CONTROLDIR
Sub-directory relative to HOME, having servercert.pem. Default is HOME/control.
