/var/indimail/qscanq

The path to the folder in which virus scanning takes place. The folder
named here is created as a daemontools service, and the actual scanning
takes place in the folder root/scanq under this folder. If your virus
software monitors files in realtime, as antivir does, then you will need
to tell it to ignore the folder named in this file, or at least the folder
root/scanq underneath it. Otherwise, your virus software may lock, move,
fix or otherwise disturb infected attachments, and cause qscanq to
allow the message through in error.
