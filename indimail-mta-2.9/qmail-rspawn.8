.TH qmail-rspawn 8
.SH NAME
qmail-rspawn \- schedule remote deliveries
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-rspawn
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qmail-rspawn
reads a series of remote delivery commands from descriptor 0,
invokes
.B qmail-remote
to perform the deliveries,
and prints the results to descriptor 1. If the environment variable QMAILREMOTE
is defined, the executable defined by QMAILREMOTE is invoked instead.

.B qmail-rspawn
sets the environment variable MESSID pointing message file in the queue.

.B qmail-rspawn
invokes
.B qmail-remote
asynchronously,
so the results may not be in the same order as the commands.

.SH Virtual Package Functionality
\fBqmail-rspawn\fR can load an external library to add functionality. The virtual package
can be loaded by setting the environment variable \fBVIRTUAL_PKG_LIB\fR or by using the
control file \fIlibindimail\fR. The value in \fIlibindimail\fR is set to
\fIlibindimail\fR.\fIso\fR by default. If there is any problem loading the library or
loading symbols required, \fBqmail-lspawn\fR will exit with -3.

Following functions should be provided by the shared library for adding features to
qmail-lspawn - get_real_domain(), is_distributed_domain(), findhost(). If such a
library is opened \fBqmail-rspawn\fR connects to MySQL(1). For a clustered domain, it queries
.B hostcntrl
in
.B MySQL(1)
to figure out the host where it needs to send out the mail using SMTP / QMTP. It sets the SMTPROUTE
environment variable if the environment variable ROUTES is set as "smtp". It sets the QMTPROUTE
environment variable if the environment variable ROUTES is set as "qmtp". To turn off this behaviour
of setting dynamically SMTPROUTE/QMTPROUTE variable, set the environment variable ROUTES=static.
If SMTPROUTE is set
.B
qmail-remote
uses SMTPROUTE variables instead of control file smtproutes and uses SMTP.
If QMTPROUTE is set
.B
qmail-remote
uses QMTPROUTE variables instead of control file qmtproutes and uses QMTP. \fBqmail-remote\fR prefers
QMTP over SMTP.
