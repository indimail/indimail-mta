FSSOS stands for Flexible Single Sign-On Solution and
has been written by Ben Goodwin.

Official website: http://fssos.sourceforge.net/

This source has been hacked and adapted to indimail as nssd from the FSSOS site.
The hacked source will also work with vpopmail by just changing the
configuration file nssd.conf

nssd is experimental and without warranty.

The hacked source can be downloaded from
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/indimail/nssd-1.0.tar.gz

Modification has been made to have user and domain in the query
e.g. mbhangui@gmail.com gets split into mbhangui as the user
and gmail.com as the domain. This split allows authentication against
IndiMail's MySQL database. By just changing the configuration, authentication
should also work for vpopmail. The other change I have made is to make the
Name Service Switch daemon supervise friendly.

You may also want to look at the wonderful original code written by Ben.

You may find this of use if you want to run a IMAP/POP3 server which does not yet have
support for IndiMail or vpopmail

Having this installed allows many IMAP/POP3 servers which use getpwnam(), getspnam(), PAM, etc to
authenticate against IndiMail's database without making a single change to the IMAP/POP3 server code.
This gives a Yet Another Way to have courier-imap, dovecot, etc to authenticate against your own
custom MySQL database.

NSSD - Name Service Switch Daemon
================================
Supported Operating Systems:
    o Linux (glibc >= 2.2.5)
    o Solaris (Sparc or Intel >= 8) (SEE NOTE BELOW)
    o FreeBSD (5.1+, prefer 5.2+)   (SEE NOTE BELOW)

Supported MySQL Versions:
    o MySQL 3.23.9 - 6.0.3-alpha

Supported Compilers:
    o GCC (2.95.2, 3.x)

Prerequisites
=============
    o Installing from source:
      o A functional compile environment (system headers, gcc, ...)
      o MySQL client library & header files (local)
      o MySQL server (local or remote)

INSTALLATION DETAILS
====================
    o If installing from source:
      o wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/indimail/nssd-1.0.tar.gz
      o ./configure --prefix=/var/indimail --default-domain=indimail.org --with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql
      o make
      o make install-strip
	  # For IndiMail, to install a supervise service, run the svctool command
      # For vpopmail, you need to have nssd run either by supervise or by your favourite method (rc, etc)
	  o ./svctool --pwdlookup=/tmp/nssd.sock --threads=5 --timeout=5000 \
	    --mysqlhost=localhost --mysqluser=indimail --mysqlpass=xxxxxxxx \
		--mysqlsocket=/tmp/mysql.sock --servicedir=/service

    On some systems, libtool insists on adding "-lc" to the link stage
    (due to the way gcc was built for that system), which breaks nssd
    threading in daemon mode.  If you see a "-lc" before a "-pthread" or
    "-lpthread", then you're in trouble.  You'll notice the broken behavior
    in the form of fewer-than-expected threads running (3) and the inability
    to kill the parent process off without a "-9" signal.  To fix this, do
    the following:
        PTRHEAD_LIBS="-lpthread -lc" ./configure
    and then run make/make install.

    If your MySQL installation is based in a strange directory, use
    the --with-mysql=DIR option of ./configure to specify.  For example,
    "./configure --with-mysql=/usr2"

    o Edit /var/indimail/etc/nssd.conf (or /var/vpopmail/etc/nssd.conf)
	  You will find nssd.conf in samples directory of the source

    o Edit (or create) /etc/nsswitch.conf such that it contains at least the
      following:
      passwd: files nssd
      shadow: files nssd

      If you don't want groups from MySQL, simply don't include 'nssd' in 
      in the 'group' line.

    o Start 'nssd' (e.g. "/var/indimail/sbin/nssd" or "/var/vpopmail/sbin/nssd")
	  you can use supervise
	  I have the following lines in the run file
      #!/bin/sh

      exec /var/indimail/bin/envdir /service/pwdlookup/variables \
      /var/indimail/bin/setuidgid indimail /var/indimail/sbin/nssd -d debug 2>&1
