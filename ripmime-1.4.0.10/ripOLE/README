	ripOLE has now started to become a useful tool in its own
	right, though it is more directly being developed for 
	incorporation into ripMIME and subsequently Xamime.

To check for [and save] attachments in a MS Office file,
	simply do the following:

	./ripole -i officefile.doc -v -d tmp

..and ripOLE will decode the attachments to the 'tmp' 
	directory

	-END.
