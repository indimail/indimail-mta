Seeing Eric tip us that we could run a "fetchmail -quit" in the
"ip-down" script, I thougt it would be neat to run a fetchmail
collection in the "ip-up" script. That way mail is collected
automatically every time I am connecting to Internet for whatever reason
(I use "diald" to automatically manage my connection).

However, it did not work. It hung right after the POP3 login. I tracked
this down to the fact that the "pppd" masks a wide range of signals and
this means a time-out does not kick in. As I run the "ip-up" script in
"bash" this masking is inheritied by "fetchmail".

So, I wrote a silly little "C" program that unmasks all signals and then
runs a command of you choice (in this case fetchmail). This is the code
for that program :-

#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>

main(int argc,char * argv[])
{
sigset_t set;

    if (argc>1)
        {
        sigfillset(&set);
        sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK,&set,NULL);
        system(argv[1]);
        }
}

I call it "allsigs". So, now in my "ip-up" I have the line :-

allsigs "fetchmail -f /etc/fetahmail"

Note the quotes as "allsigs" only looks at argv[1]. I guess this
unmasking of all signals could be added into "fetchmail" ?
