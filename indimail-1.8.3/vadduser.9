.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBvadduser\fR adds a new user to a virtual domain. The account created is
active. You can also create the user as inactive by specifying the \fB-i\fR option.
An inactive account becomes active when the user logs in (using IMAP4 or POP3).
You can use the \fBvmoduser(1)\fR command to make an account active or inactive.
The username should be either alpha-numeric or have the characters '.', '-', '_'.
The username, gecos and domain component cannot have the ':' character. The case is
changed to lower case before adding to the database. For a clustered domain,
the user is also added to the table \fBhostcntrl\fR on the \fBcontrol host\fR.
\fBvadduser\fR has setuid bit as root and must be run as root or indimail user.
Password is encrypted using \fBcrypt(3)\fR and supports all encryption methods supported by
\fBcrypt(3)\fR. The Directory Structure Layout's hashed component (See Below) is incremented
by one.

The user's home dirctory has four components
.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 3
Base Path
.IP \n+[step]
Directory Prefix
.IP \n+[step]
Domain Name
.IP \n+[step]
Hashed Component

.PP
If the domain was created using \fB\-B\fR option to \fBvadddomain\fR, the Base Path is taken
from the file .\fIbase_path\fR file in the domains directory. Else the Base Path can be defined
by the environment variable \fBBASE_PATH\fR. If this variable is not set, the value is taken
from BASE_PATH defined in indimail.h. Base Path can be provided on the command line by the
\fB\-B\fR option. The \fB\-B\fR to \fBvadduser\fR overrides environment variable and value in
the .\fIbase_path\fR file.  If \fBvfstab\fR (\fB\-b\fR option) is run periodically, \fB\-b\fR
option in \fBvadduser\fR can be used to balance optimally user creation across filesystems to
distribute the load. The \fB\-b\fR option overrides \fB\-B\fR option, environment variable
\fBBASE_PATH\fR and the file .\fIbase_path\fR in the domains directory.

The Directory Prefix depends on the first character of the username. It can have one of the
five values

.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 3
A2E: First character of username is a alphabet including and lying in between 'a' and 'e'
.IP \n+[step]
F2K: First character of username is a alphabet including and lying in between 'f' and 'k'
.IP \n+[step]
L2P: First character of username is a alphabet including and lying in between 'l' and 'p'
.IP \n+[step]
Q2S: First character of username is a alphabet including and lying in between 'q' and 's'
.IP \n+[step]
T2Zsym: First character of username is a alphabet including and lying in between 't' and 'z' or
starts with a non alphabetic character.

.PP
The Domain Name component is derived from the virtual domain (domain component) of
the username.
.PP
The Hashed Component is constructed using an adaptive directory structure which is
automatically managed by the core indimail api functions "vadduser" and "vdeluser".
This structure is known as Directory Structure Layout. For sites with 100 users or less,
all user directories are stored in the virtual domain directory. For sites that go above 100
users the adaptive directory structure goes into effect. The basic idea is to break up
the user Maildir directories across multiple directories and sub directories so that there
are never more than 100 user directories in a single directory. You can look at this
structure using the \fBprintdir(1)\fR program.
.PP
The default directory setup allows for 62 directories in 3 levels and 100 user directories
per directory. The total number of user directories is equal to
100 + (62 * 100) + (62 * 62 * 100) + (62 * 62 * 62 * 100) = over 24 million directories.
This should be more than sufficient for any site and probably goes beyond the technology
of directory structures. 
.PP
If you are going to be storing large numbers of user directories, make sure you set your
file system to have a higher than normal percentage of inodes. \fBvadduser\fR will
automatically create these directories and sub directories as needed and populate each
directory with up to 100 user accounts. As soon as a directory reaches 100 users it will
create the next directory or sub directory and store the new users directory there. 
.PP
Over a period of time, due to large no of deletions of users, the Directory Structure Layout
for all users can be regenerated using the program \fBvreorg(8)\fR.

.SH POST HANDLE
If the environment variable POST_HANDLE is set, \fBvadduser\fR executes the program defined by
the POST_HANDLE environment variable, passing \fIemail_address\fR as a parameter. If POST_HANDLE
is not defined, the program/script INDIMAIL/libexec/vadduser will be executed with \fIemail_address\fR
as a parameter.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
\fB\-V\fR
Display Version Numbers
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Set verbose mode.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fIComment\fR
Set Comment (Sets the gecos comment field)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Create the directory for the user. If this option is not given, the home directory is not
created. It gets created when the user logs in either through IMAP4 or POP3 protocol.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR \fIpasswd\fR
Expects a Standard Encrypted Password to be given on command line.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Generates Random Password. Need not give password on command line.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR
Set the account to use APOP instead of the default POP. 
.TP
\fB\-B\fR \fIbase_path\fR
Set the base path for the user's home directory. This overrides the base path defined in the domain's
directory defined in \fIINDIMAIL/users/assign\fR file, the environment variable \fBBASE_PATH\fR and
the default base path \fI/home/mail\fR.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR
Balances users across filesystems listed in fstab table as they are created. This option
should be used if vfstab (with -b option) is enabled in cron. This option overrides the
\fB\-B\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR users_per_level
By default, \fBvadduser\fR uses an adaptive directory structure based on a table dir-control
which is automatically managed by \fBvadduser(1)\fR, \fBvdeluser(1)\fR and \fBvreorg(8).
The basic idea is to break up the user Maildir directories across multiple directories and sub
directories so that there are never more than 100 user directories in a single directory. Use
this option to change the default compile time value of 100 users per directory.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR [\fIquota in bytes\fR]
Set the hard quota limit for the user. If not supplied then the default system hard quota
limit is set. The default limit is either 50M or what ever is set via --enable-hardquota.
If set to NOQUOTA then the user will have no quota limit.

If the domain has domain limits set using vmoddomlimits(1), then domain limits apply. Also,
this option will not be allowed if permission for creating quota is disabled in domain limits.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR \fIhostid\fR
For a clustered domain, this option can be used to create the user on a specific host having
\fIhostid\fR as the hostid.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR \fImdahost\fR
For a clustered domain, this option can be used to create the user on a specific cluster
having Mail Delivery Host as \fImdahost\fR.
.TP
\fIemail_address\fR
The new email address of the user. Requires the domain name as well as the user name. For
example: user@domain.com. If the domain name is not specified the user is added to the
default domain. 
.TP
\fIpassword\fR
Set the password for the user. If the password is not supplied on the command line then
vadduser will prompt standard in for the password. The password must be typed in twice. 

.PP
The user is added to the inactive table indibak (except for RFC ids postmaster and abuse)
and is treated as an inactive user until the user logs in, upon which the user record is moved
to the  active table indimail.

.SH RETURN VALUE
0 if all steps were successful, non-zero otherwise. If any of the steps fail, a diagnostic
message is printed.
