------------

	- PCRE library (Perl Compatible Regular Expression)
	http://www.pcre.org/

	From the site:

	"The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5."

	After some research and user's feedback I decided to implement pcre library into logalert, mainly because of capture sub-string capability. 

	So, for those sysadmins that are used to perl-like regular expressions, this is pretty much the same.

	The cool thing is : now it's possible to grab some strings in the regex pattern and use them as parameters in the action command. Please reffer to the README file for further information on this.

	For those who don't have pcre installed on their system, dont worry. Logalert still works fine under old 'regex.h' header file. But of course this also means you will not have the feature above.

	- BISON/YACC/LEX - Parsing now uses yacc/bison and flex;
