 *    This program un-does what "strfile" makes, thereby obtaining the
 * original file again.  This can be invoked with the name of the output
 * file, the input file, or both. If invoked with only a single argument
 * ending in ".dat", it is pressumed to be the input file and the output
 * file will be the same stripped of the ".dat".  If the single argument
 * doesn't end in ".dat", then it is presumed to be the output file, and
 * the input file is that name prepended by a ".dat".  If both are given
 * they are treated literally as the input and output files.

/*
 * Umm.  Well, when I got this thing, it didn't work like that.  It now
 * treats the *first* filename listed as the name of the datafile; if
 * the file happens to have an extension, that's stripped off and the
 * result is the name of the strings file.  If there is no extension, then
 * the datafile has '.dat' added, and the strings file is the filename.
 * The only problem with this is if you happen to have a strings file
 * with a dot in it--in that case, specify the dat file fully.
 * 
 * The program also now accepts an optional second filename, which is the
 * name of the output file; if not specified, it dumps to stdout.
 * 
 * It can also take one parameter, which defines a new separator character.
 * This was added chiefly in order to avoid having to run sed over a
 * strings file; unstr *can* do it easily, so it should.
 *
 * We also had to add some code to make the special cases of a null fortune
 * (two separators on successive lines, a common enough error when editing
 * a strings file) and no trailing separator be treated properly.  Unstr
 * now writes out a separator string at the end of a file; strfile does
 * not consider the null string following this to be a fortune.  Be careful
 * not to put an extra newline after the required last newline--if so, you'll
 * get a fortune that contains nothing but a newline.  Karo syrup, syrup.
 * For the gory details, and lots of cussing, see strfile.c
