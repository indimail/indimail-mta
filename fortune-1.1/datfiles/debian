I think it's a little fantastic to try to form a picture in people's

in and ready to go, their fingers poised over the enter key, a sweat of 
lustful anticipated beading on their upper lips."

can't put 2 words together when they're within 20 feet of a girl.

I'm personally quite happy with one stable release every two years, and
am of the opinion that trying to release more will mean we'll have to
rename the distro from "stable" to "wobbly".
