* Replace current Makefiles with an autoconf setup (maybe use
  automake?) (Do we even need this?)

* Split-off properly offensive fortune file generation (and provide a
  fake offensive fortune for when it's not installed)

* .fortunerc and /etc/fortunerc support

* More fortunes!

* Properly format all fortunes! (See notes for details)

* Localised -a and -o fortune display
