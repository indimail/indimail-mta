.SH NAME
randstr \- fetch a random text string from a specified file
.SH SYNOPIS
.BI "randstr " filename
filename.dat
.SH DESCRIPTION
In essence, 
.B randstr
is a stripped-down, minimalist version of the popular
.BR fortune (1)
program.
.PP
It reads files with the same structure as the fortunes databases, and
displays a random string.
.SS Usage
.B randstr
might be used, with a database of signatures created with a text editor
and the 
.BR strfile "(8) and " unstr (8)
utilities, to randomly change the 
.I $HOME/.signature
file.  To do so, create the necessary database as, for example,
.IR signatures " and " signatures.dat
in the home directory, and add the following line to
.IR .profile " or " .login :
.RS
.BI "randstr " signatures
.RI > .signature
.RE
.PP
As superuser, a similar sort of thing could be placed in the
.BR Pnews "(1) or " Rnmail (1)
scripts, although it should certainly test to be certain that the files
exist, and creating the files of signatures might require a good deal of
help for a lot of users.
.PP
Also as superuser, one might use 
.B randstr
with a shell or
.B Perl
script to read the 
.I etc/passwd
database and create a 
.I strfile
type database, and use this database to run a monthly lottery.
.SH BUGS
None known.
