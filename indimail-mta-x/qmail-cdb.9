.SH NAME
qmail-cdb \- prepare data in cdb format for
.BR qmail .

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-cdb
[
\fB\-r\fR
\fB\-m\fR
]
.I filename

.SH DESCRIPTION
With the -\fIr\fR option \fBqmail-cdb\fR does a chdir to ASSIGN and reads the
addresses provided in \fIrecipients\fR, converts them into lowercase, and
writes them into \fIfilename.cdb\fR in a binary format suited for quick
access by \fBqmail-smtpd\fR. Each line in \fIfilename\fR should be a
local email address. \fIfilename.cdb\fR is compatible with
\fBsetforward\fR(1)'s generated \'fastforward\' cdbs and it's format is
portable across machines. With the -\fIr\fR option, and ASSIGN/recipients
is used as the \fIfilename\fR.

Without the -\fIr\fR option \fBqmail-cdb\fR does a chdir to @controldir@ and
reads the instructions in \fIfilename\fR, converts them into lowercase, and
writes them into \fIfilename.cdb\fR in a binary format suited for quick
access by \fBqmail-smtpd\fR or \fBspawn-filter\fR.

If there is a problem with \fIfilename\fR, \fBqmail-cdb\fR complains and
leaves \fIfilename.cdb\fR alone.

\fBqmail-cdb\fR ensures that \fIfilename.cdb\fR is updated atomically, so
\fBqmail-smtpd\fR or \fBspawn-filter\fR never has to wait for
\fBqmail-cdb\fR to finish. However, \fBqmail-cdb\fR makes no attempt to
protect against two simultaneous updates of \fBfilename.cdb\fR.

The binary \fIfilename.cdb\fR format is portable across machines.
\fBqmail-cdb\fR renames \fIfilename\fR to \fIfilename.bak\fR if it
succeeds.

The \fI\-m\fR option moves \fIfilename\fR to \fIfilename.bak\fR after a
successfull conversion to cdb.

The following control files can also be converted to cdb format using
\fBqmail-cdb\fR(8).
