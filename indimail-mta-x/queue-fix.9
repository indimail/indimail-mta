.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBqueue-fix\fR [-\fBi\fR -\fBN\fR -\fBr\fR -\fBb \fIbig\fR \fR -\fBv\fR] [-s \fIsplit\fR] \fIqueue_dir\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBqueue-fix\fR analyzes and reparis the qmail queue structure. It will fix
uid/gid settings and permissions. It will rename the message files to match
their inodes. It will even create missing directories and files. You can
even create a queue from scratch). It will also print warnings for any
files it finds that should not exist. However, queue-fix doesn't attempt to
fix if it finds the wrong type of file present; e.g. regular file instead
of directory, directory instead of a regular file, fifo instead of a
regular file, regular file instead of a fifo, etc

\fBqueue-fix\fR uses environment set according to files in
$HOME/.defaultqueue directory. You can skip $HOME/.defaultqueue by setting
\fBSKIP_LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT\fR environment variable.  \fBqueue-fix\fR
additionally sets environment variables according to files in
@controldir@/defaultqueue directory (for any uid), if \fBQUEUE_BASE\fR is
not set.

\fBqueue-fix\fR uses the uids \fIqmailq\fR, \fIqmailr\fR and \fIqmails\fR
to set permissions for various directories.

\fBqueue-fix\fR needs root privileges to run.
