.TH qmail-send 8
.SH NAME
qmail-send \- deliver mail messages from the queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-send
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qmail-send
handles messages placed into the outgoing queue by
.BR qmail-queue .
.B qmail-send
by default looks at QMAILHOME/queue for messages. This path can be changed
by defining the QUEUEDIR environment variable. If you are using
\fBqmail-daemon\fR(8) to invoke qmail-send, then \fBqmail-daemon\fR will
use QUEUE_COUNT, QUEUE_START to invoke multiple qmail-send processes, with
each having its own queue defined by the \fBQUEUEDIR\fR environment variable.
\fBQUEUEDIR\fR will typically be QMAILHOME/queue/queue1, QMAILHOME/queue/queue2
and so on. This manual will refer \fIqueue\fR as the value of \fBQUEUEDIR\fR.

\fBqmail-send\fR can load startup plugins from PREFIX/usr/lib/indimail/plugins
directory. This directory can be changed by defining the \fBPLUGINDIR\fR
environment variable. By default, qmail-send will attempt to load the plugin
qmail-send.so. This can be changed by defining \fBSTART_PLUGIN\fR environment
variable. You can define multiple plugins separated by the space charater
in the \fBSTART_PLUGIN\fR variable. \fBqmail-send\fR will use \fBdlopen(3)\fR
function to load all the plugins and by default try to execute the symbol
\fIstartup\fR. The symbol to be loaded can be changed by defining the
\fBSTART_PLUGIN_SYMB\fR environment variable. \fBqmail-send\fR will terminate
if any of the loaded functions return non-zero status.

It uses \fBqmail-lspawn\fR to deliver messages to local recipients and
\fBqmail-rspawn\fR to deliver messages to remote recipients. The behaviour of
\fBqmail-lspawn\fR can be altered by setting AUTHSELF environment variable
(see qmail-lspawn(8)). The behaviour of \fBqmail-rspawn\fR can be altered by
setting ROUTES environment variable (see qmail-rspawn(8)). If a message is
temporarily undeliverable to one or more addresses, \fBqmail-send\fR leaves
it in the queue and tries the addresses again later.

\fBqmail-send\fR prints a readable record of its activities to descriptor
0. It writes commands to \fBqmail-lspawn\fR, \fBqmail-rspawn\fR, and
\fBqmail-clean\fR on descriptors 1, 3, and 5, and reads responses from
descriptors 2, 4, and 6. \fBqmail-send\fR is responsible for avoiding deadlock.

\fBqmail-send\fR uses \fBqmail-queue\fR to queue bounces and aliases/forwards.
This can be changed by using \fBQMAILQUEUE\fR environment variable. If a
different queue program is desired for bounces, it can be set by using
\fBBOUNCEQUEUE\fR environment variable.

When injecting a bounce for a previously forwarded email, whose sender was
rewritten using \fISRS\fB, \fBqmail-send\fR rewrites the recipient to the
original sender using Sender Rewriting Scheme, if \fISRS\fB has been
configured. see \fBqmail-srs\fR(5) for information on how to do this.

\fBqmail-send\fR adds the \fBX-Bounced-Address\fR header when creating a
bounce. It assigns the address that caused the bounce to this header. This
is useful for programs that generate DKIM signature to use the domain in
the \fBX-Bounced-Address\fR for the d= DKIM-Signature tag.

If \fBqmail-send\fR receives a TERM signal, it will exit cleanly, after
waiting (possibly more than a minute) for current delivery attempts to finish.

If \fBqmail-send\fR receives an ALRM signal, it will reschedule every message
in the queue for immediate delivery.

If the environment variable USE_FSYNC is set, then\fBqmail-send\fR writes
all data to disk ("flushes") all modified in-core data of (i.e., modified
buffer cache pages for) the new message to the disk device (or other
permanent storage device) so that all changed information can be
retrieved even if the system crashes or is rebooted. This includes
writing through or flushing a disk cache if present. The call blocks
until the device reports that the transfer has completed. This is done
for the info and mess files. This can also be set by using \fIconf-fsync\fR
control file.

If the environment variable USE_SYNCDIR is enabled, \fBqmail-send\fR
forces BSD style directory syncing. This can also be set by using
\fIconf-syncdir\fR control file.

The control files conf-syncdir, conf-fsync take precedence over
the environment variable counterparts. If the control conf-fsync,
conf-syncdir are present, \fBqmail-send\fR will additionally set
or unset the environment variables USE_FSYNC, USE_SYNCDIR. This feature
is exploited by \fBqmail-local(8)\fR. The fsync(2) system call is
used for doing this.

.SH "CONTROL FILES"
.B WARNING:
.B qmail-send
reads its control files only when it starts.
If you change the control files,
you must stop and restart
.BR qmail-send .
Exception:
If
.B qmail-send
receives a HUP signal,
it will reread
.IR concurrencylocal ,
.IR concurrencylocal.queue ,
.IR concurrencyremote ,
.IR concurrencyremote.queue ,
.IR locals ,
.IR virtualdomains ,
.IR holdlocal ,
.IR holdremote ,
.IR envnoathost ,
.IR conf-syncdir ,
and
.IR conf-fsync .

During startup, \fBqmail-send\fR uses the environment variable \fBLOCK_LOGS\fR and locks the file
CONTROLDIR/defaultdelivery before writing a line to the log file (or stdout). If multiple qmail-send
processes are running, all writing to one multilog, lines may get jumbled up in extreme situations.
This can be avoided by setting LOCK_LOGS environment variable.
If
.B qmail-send
receives a INT signal, it will toggle log lock synchronization. If log locking is set, it will get
turned off and vice versa.

.B qmail-send
by default looks at @controldir@ for all control files. This path can be changed by
defining the \fBCONTROLDIR\fR environment variable.

.TP 5
.I bouncefrom
Bounce username.
Default:
.BR MAILER-DAEMON .

.TP 5
.I bouncehost
Bounce host.
Default:
.IR me ,
if that is supplied;
otherwise the literal name
.BR bouncehost ,
which is probably not what you want.
If a message is permanently undeliverable,
.B qmail-send
sends a
.B single-bounce
notice back to the message's envelope sender.
The notice is
.B From: \fIbouncefrom\fB@\fIbouncehost\fR,
although its envelope sender is empty.

.TP 5
.I bouncemaxbyte
Limit the size of bounces. Default: 50000 bytes.

.TP 5
.I bouncesubject
Configures the bounce message subject

.TP 5
.I bouncemessage
Text for bounce message. Remember that this may break QSBMF

.TP 5
.I doublebouncehost
Double-bounce host.
Default:
.IR me ,
if that is supplied;
otherwise the literal name
.BR doublebouncehost ,
which is probably not what you want.

.TP 5
.I doublebounceto
User to receive double-bounces.
Default:
.BR postmaster .
If a single-bounce notice is permanently undeliverable,
.B qmail-send
sends a
.B double-bounce
notice to
.IR doublebounceto\fB@\fIdoublebouncehost .
(If that bounces,
.B qmail-send
gives up.)
As a special case, if the first line of
.IR doublebounceto
contains a '@' or is blank (contains a single linefeed), qmail-send will not queue
the double-bounce at all.

.TP 5
.I doublebouncesubject
Configures the double bounce message subject

.TP 5
.I doublebouncemessage
Text for double bounce message. Remember that this may break QSBMF

.TP 5
.I concurrencylocal
Maximum number of simultaneous local delivery attempts.
Default: 10.
If 0, local deliveries will be put on hold.
.I concurrencylocal
is limited at compile time to
SPAWN.

.TP 5
.I concurrencylocal.queue
Maximum number of simultaneous local delivery attempts for the queue \fIqueue\fR. A queue
can be defined by setting \fBQUEUEDIR\fR environment variable.
Default: 10.
If 0, local deliveries will be put on hold.
.I concurrencylocal
is limited at compile time to
SPAWN.

.TP 5
.I concurrencyremote
Maximum number of simultaneous remote delivery attempts.
Default: 20.
If 0, remote deliveries will be put on hold.
.I concurrencyremote
is limited at compile time to
SPAWN.

.TP 5
.I concurrencyremote.queue
Maximum number of simultaneous remote delivery attempts for the queue \fIqueue\fR. A queue
can be defined by setting \fBQUEUEDIR\fR environment variable.
Default: 20.
If 0, remote deliveries will be put on hold.
.I concurrencyremote
is limited at compile time to
SPAWN.

.TP 5
.I envnoathost
Presumed domain name for addresses without @ signs.
Default:
.IR me ,
if that is supplied;
otherwise the literal name
.BR envnoathost ,
which is probably not what you want.
If
.B qmail-send
sees an envelope recipient address without an @ sign,
it appends
.B @\fIenvnoathost\fR.

.TP 5
.I locals
List of domain names that the current host
receives mail for,
one per line.
Default:
.IR me ,
if that is supplied;
otherwise
.B qmail-send
refuses to run.
An address 
.I user@domain
is considered local if
.I domain
is listed in
.IR locals .

.TP 5
.I percenthack
List of domain names where the percent hack is applied.
If
.I domain
is listed in
.IR percenthack ,
any address of the form
.I user%fqdn@domain
is rewritten as
.IR user@fqdn .
.I user
may contain %,
so the percent hack may be applied repeatedly.
.B qmail-send
handles
.I percenthack
before
.IR locals .

.TP 5
.I queuelifetime
Number of seconds
a message can stay in the queue.
Default: 604800 (one week).
After this time expires,
.B qmail-send
will try the message once more,
but it will treat any temporary delivery failures as
permanent failures.

.TP 5
.I bouncelifetime
Number of seconds
a bounce message can stay in the queue.
Default: 604800 (one week).
After this time expires,
.B qmail-send
will try the message once more,
but it will treat any temporary delivery failures as
permanent failures.

.TP 5
.I bounce.envrules
Specific environment variables can be set for bounce recipients. The format of this file is of the form
pat:envar1=val,envar2=val,...]   where pat is a regular expression which matches a bounce recipient.
envar1, envar2 are list of environment variables to be set. If var is omitted, the environment variable is unset.

The name of the control file can be overriden by the environment variable BOUNCERULES

Example:
answerme@save*:CONTROLDIR=control2,QMAILQUEUE=

sets CONTROLDIR to control2 for the sender answerme@saveme.com and unsets QMAILQUEUE environment variable. If
there are multiple lines for a pattern, all lines are applied. However if an environment
variable is being set in multiple lines, the last rule takes precedence. The environment variable QREGEX can be set to
use regular expressions for matching pat instead of the internal wildmat function.

Example:
answerme@save*:DATABYTES=2000000,MAXRECIPIENT=2,QMAILQUEUE=
answerme@save*:DATABYTES=4000000

DATABYTES gets set to 4 MB in for any email matching answerme@save*

.TP 5
.I virtualdomains
List of virtual users or domains, one per line.
A virtual user has the form
.IR user\fB@\fIdomain\fB:\fIprepend ,
without any extra spaces.
When
.B qmail-send
sees the recipient address
.IR user\fB@\fIdomain ,
it converts it to
.I prepend\fB-\fIuser\fB@\fIdomain
and treats it as local.

A virtual domain has the form
.IR domain\fB:\fIprepend .
It applies to any recipient address at
.IR domain .
For example, if

.EX
     nowhere.mil:joeBREAKfoo
.EE

is in
.IR virtualdomains ,
and a message arrives for
.BR info@nowhere.mil ,
.B qmail-send
will rewrite the recipient address as
.B joeBREAKfoo-info@nowhere.mil
and deliver the message locally.

.I virtualdomains
may contain wildcards:

.EX
     .fax:uucpBREAKfax
     :aliasBREAKcatchall
     .nowhere.mil:joeBREAKfoo-host
.EE

.I virtualdomains
may also contain exceptions:
an empty
.I prepend
means that
.I domain
is not a virtual domain.

.B qmail-send
handles
.I virtualdomains
after
.IR locals :
if a domain is listed in
.IR locals ,
.I virtualdomains
does not apply.

.TP 5
.I holdlocal
A boolean parameter indicating whether mail for local
hosts should be queued without delivery.  Zero indicates
delivery as normal; any other value causes local mail to
be held.
Default:
.IR zero

.TP 5
.I holdremote
A boolean parameter indicating whether mail for remote
hosts should be queued without delivery.  Zero indicates
delivery as normal; any other value causes remote mail to
be held.  This is provided to permit use of qmail in a 
dial-up environment when the remote delivery path may not
always be available, as an alternative to the use of serialmail.
Default:
.IR zero

.TP 5
.I conf-fsync
A boolean parameter to turn on fsync of file descriptors
when writing to a file during delivery

.TP 5
.I conf-syncdir
A boolean parameter to turn on BSD style sync semantics for flushing directories.

.SH "External BOUNCE Processor"
.B qmail-send
will execute an external program defined by the environment variable
.I BOUNCEPROCESSOR
when delivery to a recipient fails. The external program will be called with the following
arguments

.I original_message_file
.I bounce_file
.I bounce_report
.I bounce_sender
.I original_recipient
.I bounce_recipient

The external program runs with uid of \fIqmails\fR. If the bounce script exits 1, the bounce is
discarded. You should be very careful in writing your own bounce processor. If the bounce
processor program returns non-zero exit status (other than an exit value of 1),
\fBqmail-send\fR will continue to retry the script. Also just like bounces, bounce processor
is not crash-proof. In case your bounce processor genuinely returns non-zero exit status and
you shut qmail-send, you will not be able to again get back to retry the bounce that the processor
was handling.

.SH Retry Schedule
Each message has its own retry schedule. The longer a message remains
undeliverable, the less frequently qmail tries to send it. The retry
schedule is not configurable. The following table shows the retry
schedule for a message that's undeliverable to a recipient
until it bounces. Local messages a similar, but more frequent,
schedule than remote messages.

.B Local Retry Schedule
is governed by 100 * (x * x), where x is the try number
