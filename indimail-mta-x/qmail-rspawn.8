.SH NAME
qmail-rspawn \- schedule remote deliveries

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-rspawn

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBqmail-rspawn\fr reads a series of remote delivery commands from
descriptor 0, invokes \fBqmail-remote\fR to perform the deliveries, and
prints the results to descriptor 1. If the environment variable
\fBQMAILREMOTE\fR is defined, the executable defined by QMAILREMOTE is
invoked instead.

\fBqmail-rspawn\fR sets the environment variable \fBMESSID\fR pointing
to the message file in the queue.

\fBqmail-rspawn\fR invokes \fBqmail-remote\fR or the path defined by
QMAILREMOTE environment variable asynchronously, so the results may not be
in the same order as the commands.

\fBqmail-rspawn\fR runs as \fIqmailr\fR user, \fIqmail\fR group and with
supplementary groups defined for \fIqmailr\fR user if the environment
variable \fBUSE_SETGROUPS\fR is set for \fBqmail-start\fR(8).

.SH Virtual Package Functionality
\fBqmail-rspawn\fR can load an external library to add functionality. The
virtual package can be loaded by setting the environment variable
\fBVIRTUAL_PKG_LIB\fR or by using the control file \fIlibindimail\fR. The
value in \fIlibindimail\fR is set to \fIlibindimail\fR.\fIso\fR by default.
If there is any problem loading the library or loading symbols required,
\fBqmail-lspawn\fR will exit with -3.

Following functions should be provided by the shared library for adding
features to qmail-lspawn - get_real_domain(), is_distributed_domain(),
findhost(). If such a library is opened \fBqmail-rspawn\fR connects to
MySQL(1). For a clustered domain, it queries \fBhostcntrl\fR in
\fBMySQL\fR(1) to figure out the host where it needs to send out the mail
using SMTP / QMTP. It sets the \fBSMTPROUTE\fR environment variable if the
environment variable \fBROUTES\fR is set as "smtp". It sets the
\fBQMTPROUTE\fR environment variable if the environment variable ROUTES is
set as "qmtp". To turn off this behaviour of setting dynamically
SMTPROUTE/QMTPROUTE variable, set the environment variable
\fBROUTES\fR=static.  If SMTPROUTE is set \fBqmail-remote\fR uses
\fBSMTPROUTE\fR variables instead of control file smtproutes and uses SMTP.
If \fBQMTPROUTE\fR is set \fBqmail-remote\fR uses \fBQMTPROUTE\fR variables
instead of control file qmtproutes and uses QMTP. \fBqmail-remote\fR
prefers QMTP over SMTP.
