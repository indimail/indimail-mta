.SH "INTRODUCTION"
Hosts which adopt the Sender Permitted From (SPF) convention face a
challenge when required to forward mail. If the forwarding host does not
change the sender domain, it will fail the SPF test and may not be able to
hand the message off to the recipient. The Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) is
a scheme for bypassing the Sender Policy Framework's (SPF) methods of
preventing forged sender addresses. SPF "breaks" email forwarding. SRS is a
way to fix it. SRS is a simple way for forwarding MTAs to rewrite the
sender address. indimail-mta's SRS implementation has been adapted from Marcelo
Coelho's qmail SRS patch. The base SRS functions comes from libsrs2.

You can configure indimail system for SRS by modifying
.BR indimail-mta 's
.I control files
in
.BR @controldir@ .
You can set the environment variable \fBCONTROLDIR\fR to make indimail-mta
look for control files in a different directory. The control files
\fIsrs_domain\fR and \fIsrs_secrets\fR are mandatory.

.SH CONTROL FILES

.TP
.I srs_domain
A domain to use in rewritten address. If not set, SRS is disabled.
You must create a MX record for srs\.\fIdomain\fR.  If your
\fIdomain\fR is example.com, this will be.

.EX
srs.example.com
.EE

.TP
.I srs_secrets
A random string to generate and check SRS addresses. You can specify
a list of secrets (one per line). The first secret in the list is used
for generating new SRS addresses. All secrets on the list may be used to
verify SRS addresses. You can use the following command to generate a
random string of 24 charactoers.

.EX
$ tr -dc 'A-Za-z0-9!"#$%&'\''()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~' \
	</dev/urandom | head -c 24; echo
.EE

.TP 5
.I srs_maxage
The maximum permitted age of a rewritten address. SRS rewritten addresses
expire after a specified number of days. libsrs2 default is 21. But a week
is enough to get all bounces. Recommended value is 7

.TP 5
.I srs_hashlength
The hash length to generate in a rewritten address. The hash length is a
measure of security in the SRS system; longer is more secure.
Recommended value 4

.TP 5
.I srs_hashmin
The hash length to require when checking an address. If the hash length is
increased, there may be SRS addresses from your MTA in the wild which use a
shorted hash length. This paramter may be sit to permit checking of hashes
shorter than \fIsrs_hashlength\fR. This parameter should be at most
\fIsrs_hashlength\fR. Recommended value 4

.TP 5
.I srs_separator
The separator to appear immediately after SRS[01] in rewritten addresses.
This must be \-, + or =. Default value is =

.TP 5
.I srs_alwaysrewrite
Skip \fIrcpthosts\fR check and perform SRS rewriting for all forwarding,
even when not required. This must be 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled).
Default value is 0
