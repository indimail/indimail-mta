.SH NAME
cdb-database \- prepare cdb assignments for ctrlenv
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcdb-database\fR \fIfilename\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcdb-database\fR reads the assignments in \fICONTROL/filename\fR and
writes them into \fICONTROL/filename.cdb\fR in a binary format suited for
quick access by \fBctrlenv\fR. Extra arguments provided after
\fIfilename\fR are silently ignored.

If there is a problem with \fICONTROL/filename\fR, \fBcdb-database\fR
complains and leaves \fICONTROL/filename.cdb\fR alone.

\fBcdb-database\fR ensures that \fICONTROL/filename.cdb\fR is updated
atomically, so \fBctrlenv\fR never has to wait for \fBcdb-database\fR to
finish. However, \fBcdb-database\fR makes no attempt to protect against two
simultaneous updates of \fICONTROL/filename.cdb\fR.

The binary \fICONTROL/filename.cdb\fR format is portable across machines.

\fBCONTROL/filename\fR is a series of assignments, one per line. It ends
with a line containing a single dot. Lines must not contain NUL.

Lines in \fICONTROL/filename\fR consists of \fIaddress\fR separated by
\fIvalue\fR

.EX
=joe.shmoe@indimail.org:DKIMSIGN=CONTROL/domainkeys/joe:
.EE

When \fBctrlenv\fR is run against this file using address
joe.shmoe@indimail.org, DKIMSIGN will be set to
\fICONTROL/domainkeys/joe\fR

.SH "SIMPLE ASSIGNMENTS"
A simple assignment is a line of the form

.EX
=local:value:
.EE

Here \fIlocal\fR is an address;
\fIvalue\fR is the value of environment variable that \fBctrlenv\fR will
set when it finds a match for address \fIlocal\fR.

If there are several assignments for the same \fIlocal\fR address,
\fBctrlenv\R will use the first one.

\fIlocal\fR is interpreted without regard to case.

.SH "WILDCARD ASSIGNMENTS"
A wildcard assignment is a line of the form

.EX
+loc:value:
.EE

This assignment applies to any address beginning with \fIloc\fR, including
\fIloc\fR itself. It means the same as

.EX
=locext:value:
.EE

for every string \fIext\fR .

A more specific wildcard assignment overrides a less specific assignment,
and a simple assignment overrides any wildcard assignment. For example:

.EX
+:CONTROL/domainkeys/%/default:
+joe-:CONTROL/domainkeys/indimail.org/joe:
=joe:CONTROL/domainkeys/example.com/joe:
.EE

The address \fBjoe\fR is handled by the third line;
the address \fBjoe-direct\fR is handled by the second line;
the address \fBbill\fR is handled by the first line.
