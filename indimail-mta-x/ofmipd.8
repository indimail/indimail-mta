.SH NAME
ofmipd \- accept outgoing mail through OFMIP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ofmipd
[
.I name.cdb
.I hostname
.I checkpasswd
.I falsepgm
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ofmipd
accepts mail messages through the Old-Fashioned Mail Injection Protocol
(OFMIP), rewrites them according to local rules, and invokes
.B qmail-queue
to deposit them into the outgoing queue.
.B ofmipd
must be supplied several environment variables;
see
.BR tcp-environ (5).

See
.B https://cr.yp.to/proto/ofmip.html
for further information on OFMIP.
.SH "USING OFMIP"
You can use
.B tcpserver
to set up
.B ofmipd
on a free TCP port. Some sites use port 26. Some sites use port 25 on an IP
address that does not receive incoming mail.

The
.I hostname
argument is the name of the mail host, intended to create CRAM password
challenges but currently ignored. The
.I checkpasswd
argument is the name of a password checker that uses the same calling
conventions as the qmail POP3 checkpasswd.
The
.I falsepgm
argument is the name a program that fails, such as
.BR /bin/false\c.

If the environment variable RELAYCLIENT is set, or the client logs in with
AUTH,
.B ofmipd
will relay messages to any destination. If not, it will reject any MAIL
FROM, RCPT TO, or DATA command with a 503 error. With
.B tcpserver
you can set RELAYCLIENT for preauthorized IP addresses such as 127.0.0.1.
The contents of RELAYCLIENT are ignored; in particular, they are not
appended to destnation mail addresses.

Most MUAs that claim to be ``SMTP clients'' are actually OFMIP clients. You
should point them at
.B ofmipd
rather than
.BR qmail-smtpd .
Some MUAs will use port 26 of 
.I server
if you tell them that the ``SMTP server'' is
.IR server\fB:26 .

.SH "MESSAGE REWRITING"
.B ofmipd
rewrites each message in essentially the same way that
.B new-inject
does.
It transforms each envelope address
as discussed in
.BR rewriting (5);
it cleans up address lists in
.BR To ,
.BR Cc ,
.BR Notice-Requested-Upon-Delivery-To ,
.BR From ,
.BR Sender ,
.BR Reply-To ,
.BR Mail-Reply-To ,
and
.BR Mail-Followup-To ;
it adds
.B Date
and
.BR Message-ID ;
it discards
.BR Bcc ,
.BR Apparently-To ,
.BR Content-Length ,
and
.BR Return-Path ;
and it moves various fields to the top of the message.

.B ofmipd
also transforms envelope sender addresses and
.B From
lines according to
.I name.cdb
if
.I name.cdb
is supplied.
See
.BR ofmipname (8)
for further details.
he
I name.cdb
rgument must be supplied but may be a null string of no name
ransformation file is to be used.

.B ofmipd
accepts LF and CR LF as line terminators inside messages.

.B ofmipd
does not do hop counting
or local-IP-address recognition.
