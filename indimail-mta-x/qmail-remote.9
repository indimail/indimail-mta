.SH NAME
qmail-remote \- send mail via SMTP / ESMTP or QMTP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-remote
.I host
.I sender
.I qqeh
.I size
.I recip
[ \fIrecip\fR ... ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBqmail-remote\fR reads a mail message from its input and sends the
message to one or more recipients at a remote host. The remote host
\fIhost\fR is \fBqmail-remote\fR's first argument. \fBqmail-remote\fR sends
the message to \fIhost\fR, or to a mail exchanger for \fIhost\fR listed in
the Domain Name System, via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP/ESMTP)
or the Quick Mail Transfer Protocol (QMTP). QMTP is implemented by
\fBqmail-qmtpd\fR. \fIhost\fR can be either a fully-qualified domain name:

.EX
     silverton.berkeley.edu
.EE

or an IP address enclosed in brackets:

.EX
     [128.32.183.163]
.EE

The size parameter is only used if the remote host uses the ESMTP SIZE
extension defined in \fIRFC- 1870\fR. It gives the size of the message in
bytes. \fBqmail-remote\fR does not use this value to process the mail, the
value is only passed to the remote mailserver.

The envelope recipient addresses are listed as \fIrecip\fR arguments to
\fBqmail-remote\fR.

The envelope sender address is listed as \fIsender\fR.

If the environment variable SMTPUTF8 is defined, qmail-remote will respect
SMTPUTF8 and EAI addresses. If message is utf8, qmail-remote will
use idn2_lookup_u8(3) to perform IDNA2008 lookup string conversion
on \fIhost\fR.

Any Qmail Queue Extra Header (QQEH) information passed to
\fBqmail-queue\fR(8), is passed in the \fIqqeh\fR argument.

If \fBqmail-remote\fR is not able to get the greeting from the remote SMTP
server, it tries the next MX (as per \fBrfc-2821(5)\fR) under the following
conditions

1. connection to remote host gets dropped without a greeting from the
   remote host

2. greeting code >= 400 and < 500

3. ehlo/helo code >= 400 and < 500 (enabled by setting
   TRY_NEXT_MX_HELO_FAIL environment variable)

4. connection to the remote host times out.

In these cases, the remote host's IP address is recorded in the timeout
table QMAILHOME/queue/lock/tcpto, which causes subsequent deliveries to
back off from the IP address and try the next MX (if it exists).
\fBqmail-tcpto(8)\fR can be used to print the TCP timeout table.

\fBqmail-remote\fR is MXPS compliant. If it sees the MX record

     12801 mailin-01.mx.aol.com

it will try a QMTP connection to mailin-01.mx.aol.com before trying a SMTP
connection to mailin-01.mx.aol.com. The point is that QMTP is faster than
SMTP. If the QMTP connection attempt fails, the client tries a SMTP
connection to port 25 as usual. \fBqmail-remote\fR does not try SMTP if the
QMTP connection attempt succeeds but mail delivery through that connection
fails. You can disable MXPS by setting \fBDISABLE_MXPS\fR environment
variable.

\fBqmail-remote\fR will issue the STARTTLS command if it finds the remote
server supports STARTTLS and it finds a valid certificate in
\fISYSCONF/certs/clientcert.pem\fR. \fBqmail-remote\fR will revert
to non-encrypted session if the TLS connection fails.

\fBqmail-remote\fR can use authenticated SMTP for remote deliveries if
username and secret is provided in the SYSCONF/smtproutes control file
described in the section \fBCONTROL FILES\fR. \fBqmail-remote\fR uses
libgsasl to use GNU Simple Authentication and Security Layer detailed here
https://www.gnu.org/software/gsasl. \fBqmail-remote\fR supports LOGIN,
PLAIN, CRAM-MD5, CRAM-SHA1, CRAM-SHA224, CRAM-SHA256, CRAM-SHA384,
CRAM-RIPEMD, DIGEST-MD5 authentication using built-in functions and
SCRAM-SHA-1, SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS, SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS
authentication provided by libgsasl. Note that DIGEST-MD5 has been moved to
historic (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6331.html).

\fBqmail-remote\fR supports \fBBounce Address Tag Validation (BATV)\fR.
It uses BATV to replace an envelope sender like mailbox@example.com with
prvs=tag-value=mailbox@example.com, where prvs, called
"Simple Private Signature", is just one of the possible tagging schemes;
actually, the only one fully specified in the draft. The BATV draft gives a
framework that other possible techniques can fit into. Other types of
implementations, such as using public key signatures that can be verified
by third parties, are mentioned but left undefined. Having the control file
\fIsignkey\fR or setting the environment variable \fBSIGNKEY\fR enables
BATV. When a bounce is received by \fBqmail-smtpd\fR(8) it can check the
validity of the signature in the tagged envelope sender address and reject
in case the signature is invalid.

.SH CUSTOMIZING qmail-remote
\fBqmail-remote\fR normally gets called by \fBqmail-rspawn\fR but can be
called by \fBspawn-filter\fR when you set the \fBQMAILREMOTE\fR environment
variable to PREFIX/sbin/spawn-filter. \fBspawn-filter\fR(8) can do tasks
like filtering, running custom scripts, etc before running qmail-remote.
\fBqmail-remote\fR is controlled by several environment variables,
described in this manual. It is possible to have an elaborate scheme to run
a custom script/program instead of \fBqmail-remote\fR by setting the
\fBQMAILREMOTE\fR environment variable as full path to your custom
script/program. The custom script can then call \fBqmail-remote\fR after
doing certain things. A useful utility to call in such custom
scripts/programs is the \fBctrlenv\fR(8) utility. ctrlenv(8) can call
\fBqmail-remote\fR after seting various environment variables based on the
\fIrecip\fR address. Note that \fBqmail-remote\fR does does not follow the
\fBgetopt\fR standard and it is not possible to set options. In cases where
you want a customized behaviour, it is possible to do that with a
combination of \fBQMAILREMOTE\fR and the \fBctrlenv\fR(8) utility.

.SH DANE VERIFICATION

\fBqmail-remote\fR supports DANE verfication, described in RFC-7671. if the
environment variable \fBDANE_VERIFICATION\fR is set without '@' sign, then
\fBqmail-remote\fR will use it's own internal dane verification function.

.EX
   DANE_VERIFICATION=""
.EE

If this variable is set as host@port, then qmail-remote will use the
tlsacheck(3) function and attempt to verify DANE status by connecting
to \fBqmail-daned\fR(8) - qmail DANE verification daemon

.EX
   DANE_VERIFICATION="127.0.0.1@1998"
.EE

DANE verification can be restricted on per host basis by having the
\fItlsadomains\fR control file.

.SH TRANSPARENCY
End-of-file in SMTP is encoded as dot CR LF. A dot at the beginning of a
line is encoded as dot dot. It is impossible in SMTP to send a message that
does not end with a newline. \fBqmail-remote\fR converts the UNIX newline
convention into the SMTP newline convention by inserting CR before each LF.

It is a violation of the SMTP protocol to send a message that contains long
lines or non-ASCII characters. However, \fBqmail-remote\fR will happily
send such messages. It is the user's responsibility to avoid generating
illegal messages.

\fBqmail-remote\fR may use SMTP Authenticaton to connect to remote hosts.
The following reports are provided:

.TP 5
K

.TP 5
Z

.SH "RESULTS"
\fBqmail-remote\fR prints some number of \fIrecipient reports\fR,
followed by a \fImessage report\fR. Each report is terminated by a 0 byte.
Each report begins with a single letter:

.TP 5
r
Recipient report: acceptance.

.TP 5
h
Recipient report: permanent rejection.

.TP 5
s
Recipient report: temporary rejection.

.TP 5
K
Message report: success. \fIhost\fR has taken responsibility for
delivering the message to each acceptable recipient.

.TP 5
Z
Message report: temporary failure.

.TP 5
D
Message report: permanent failure.

.PP
After this letter comes a human-readable description of what happened.

The recipient reports will always be printed in the same order as
\fBqmail-remote\fR's \fIrecip\fR arguments. Note that in failure cases
there may be fewer recipient reports than \fI recip\fR arguments.

If \fBONSUCCESS_REMOTE\fR environment variable is defined and points to a
program, \fBqmail-remote\fR will execute the same, with uid \fIqmailr\fR,
on successful email delivery to remote host \fIhost\fR. The exit status of
\fBqmail-remote\fR will be the exit status of the program. The argument
passed to this program will be the same as those for \fBqmail-remote\fR.

If \fBONFAILURE_REMOTE\fR environment variable is defined and points to a
program, \fBqmail-remote\fR will execute the same, with uid \fIqmailr\fR,
on a failed email delivery to remote host \fIhost\fR. The exit status of
\fBqmail-remote\fR will be the exit status of the program. The argumen
t passed to this program will be the same as those for \fBqmail-remote\fR.

If \fBONTEMPORARY_REMOTE\fR environment variable is defined and points to a
program, \fBqmail-remote\fR will execute the same, with uid \fIqmailr\fR,
on a deferred email delivery to remote host \fIhost\fR. The exit status of
\fBqmail-remote\fR will be the exit status of the program. The argument
passed to this program will be the same as those for \fBqmail-remote\fR.

If neither of these variables \fBONSUCCESS_REMOTE\fR,
\fBONFAILURE_REMOTE\fR and \fBONTEMPORARY_REMOTE\fR are defined,
\fBqmail-remote\fR will always return zero exit status.

When these two variables are set, \fBqmail-remote\fR will also set the
following environment variables

.TP
.B SMTPTEXT
This will contain last SMTP conversion with the remote SMTP server. In case of any error,
this will contain the latest local error that happened while conversing with the remote
SMTP server.

.TP
.B SMTPCODE
This will contain the 3 digit SMTP code returned by the remote SMTP server.

.TP
.B SMTPHOST
This will contain the IP of the remote SMTP server

.TP
.B SMTPSTATUS
This will be either 'D' or 'Z' indicating permanent or temporary failure
response from the remote SMTP server.

.PP
\fBqmail-remote\fR uses many environment variables. These environment
variables can be recipient specific by using envrules. See
\fBspawn-filter(8)\fR for more details.

.SH "CONTROL FILES"
\fBqmail-remote\fR by default looks at SYSCONF/control for all control
files. This path can be changed by defining the CONTROLDIR environment
variable.

.TP 5
.I outgoingip
file containing local IP addresses to be bound on socket and used on
outgoing connections. Default: system-defined. The value \fI0.0.0.0\fR is
equivalent to the system default. You can have multiple IP addresses one
per line, one per line for each IP. \fBqmail-remote\fR will use the
modulus operator with the current time to pick a single IP address.

.TP 5
.I outgoingip.host
file having a local IP address to be bound on socket and used on outgoing
connections. \fIhost\fR is the domain or host to which the mail is being
delivered. \fI outgoingip.host\fR takes precedence over \fIoutgoingip\fR.
You can also set the IP address for outgoing connection by setting the
environment variable \fBOUTGOINGIP\fR. \fBOUTGOINGIP\fR overrides the
control files \fIoutgoingip\fR and \fIoutgoingip.host\fR. You can have
multiple IP addresses, one per line for each IP. \fBqmail-remote\fR will
use the modulus operator with the current time to pick a single IP address.

.TP 5
.I domainbindings
file having local IP addresses to be bound based on envelope sender domain
or envelope sender address. Each binding has the form
\fIdomain\fR:\fIlocal-ip\fR, or \fIsender_addr\fR:\fIlocal-ip\fR ,
without any extra spaces.
If \fIdomain\fR matches \fI host\fR, or \fIsender_addr\fR matches
\fI sender\fR, \fBqmail-remote\fR will bind the local side of the socket
for the outgoing connection to \fIlocal-ip\fR. \fIlocal-ip\fR may be empty;
this tells \fBqmail-remote\fR to let the OS choose the local address for
outgoing connections as usual. \fIdomainbindings\fR may include wildcards:

.EX
 user1@example.com:6.5.4.3
 example.com:5.6.7.8
 .example.com:5.6.7.9
 heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.4
 :1.2.3.5
.EE

Here the connection for any message with an envelope sender address ending
with \fB.example.com\fR (but not \fBexample.com\fR itself) is bound to
local address \fB 5.6.7.9\fR, while envelope senders in \fBexample.com\fR
(but not \fBuser1@example.com\fR itself) are bound to \fB5.6.7.8\fR, and
senders in \fBheaven.af.mil\fR are bound to \fB 1.2.3.4\fR. Connection for
message with an envelope sender address of \fBuser1@example.com\fR gets
bound to \fB6.5.4.3\fR. All other outgoing connections (including messages
with the null return-path) use the OS-chosen default local address. If you
have the following line,

.EX
 :1.2.3.5
.EE

then all connections with address not matching any line in
\fIdomainbindings\fR, will get bound to \fB1.2.3.5\fR. The \fB qmail\fR
system does not protect you if you specify an invalid local address to
bind to. \fIdomainbindings\fR takes precedence over \fIoutgoingip\fR. The
name for domainbindings control file can be configured by setting
\fBDOMAINBINDINGS\fR environment variable.

.TP 5
.I bindroutes
Artificial interface binding routes. Each route has the form
\fIremote-address\fR:\fIlocal-address\fR, without any extra spaces. If the
address of the host to which we are delivering matches the remote address,
then bind the socket to the interface matching the local address, making it
appear as if the connection had originated from the named local address
instead of the default local address. \fIbindroutes\fR may contain suffix
wildcards. \fIbindroutes\fR takes precedence over \fIdomainbindings\fR.

.EX
# Send this on the internal net
10.:10.0.0.1
# Rest goes on external "mail" address (yes, its bogus!)
:301.32.1.1
# Hey, we could 'cheat' on stopping qmail-remote sending to this host
555.123.123.123:this-isnt-an-ip-address
.EE

.TP 5
.I helohost
Current host name, for use solely in saying hello to the remote SMTP server.
Default: \fIme\fR, if that is supplied; otherwise \fBqmail-remote\fR
refuses to run. If the envelope sender address matches a domain in the
\fIdomainbindings\fR control file, the envelope sender domain will be used
instead of this value.

.TP 5
.I helohostbyip
Map helohost for specific outgoing IPs.s, for use solely in saying hello to
the remote SMTP server. Default: \fIme\fR, if that is supplied; otherwise
\fBqmail-remote\fR refuses to run. If the envelope sender address matches
a domain in the \fIdomainbindings\fR control file, the envelope sender
domain will be used instead of this value.

.TP 5
.I smtproutes
Artificial SMTP routes. Each route has the form \fIdomain\fR:\fIrelay\fR,
without any extra spaces. If \fIdomain\fR matches \fIhost\fR,
\fBqmail-remote\fR will connect to \fIrelay\fR, as if \fIhost\fR had
\fIrelay\fR as its only MX. (It will also avoid doing any CNAME lookups on
\fIrecip\fR.) \fIrelay\fR may include a colon and a port number to use
instead of the normal SMTP port, 25:

.EX
   inside.af.mil:firewall.af.mil:26
.EE

\fIrelay\fR may be empty; this tells \fBqmail-remote\fR to look up MX
records as usual. \fIport\fR value of 465 (deprecated smtps port) causes
TLS session to be started. \fIsmtproutes\fR may include wildcards:

.EX
   .af.mil:
   :heaven.af.mil
.EE

Here any address ending with \fB.af.mil\fR (but not \fBaf.mil\fR itself) is
routed by its MX records; any other address is artificially routed to
\fBheaven.af.mil\fR.

The \fBqmail\fR system does not protect you if you create an artificial
mail loop between machines. However, you are always safe using
\fIsmtproutes\fR if you do not accept mail from the network. Additionally,
\fIsmtproutes\fR allows to forward bounces (with
a 'Nullsender' MAIL FROM: <>) literally expressed as '!@' to a particular
bounce host:

.EX
   !@:bouncehost.af.mil:27
.EE

You can override the smtproutes filename by setting environment variable
SMTPROUTESFILE.

The smtproutes control file is bypassed if the SMTPROUTE environment
variable is set by \fBqmail-rspawn\fR. The SMTPROUTE environment variable
has the same format as the entries in smtproutes control files. It is used
in a clustered environment where a single domain can exist across multiple
hosts. In such a case the SMTPROUTE variable points to the host where the
user's mailbox lies. You can also use X-SMTPROUTES environment variable.
SMTPROUTE env variable takes precendence over X-SMTPROUTES variable. Unlike
SMTPROUTE, X-SMTPROUTES variable is not unset by qmail-rspawn for each
delivery.

route may also have the form

.EX
\fIdomain\fB:\fIrelay\fB:\fIport\fB:\fIpenalty\fB:\fImax_tolerance<sp>username<sp>\fIpassword\fR
or
\fIdomain\fB:\fIrelay\fB:\fIport\fB<sp>username<sp>\fIpassword\fR
.EE

without any extra spaces. If the environment variable \fBAUTH_SMTP\fR is
set, \fBqmail-remote\fR will use \fIusername\fR and \fIpassword\fR (or
\fIsecret\fR for SCRAM authentication methods) to relay out mails through
server \fIrelay\fR using authenticated SMTP. <sp> is a single space
character. AUTH_SMTP can also have the values SCRAM-SHA-1, SCRAM-SHA-256,
SCRAM-SHA256, SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS, SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS, DIGEST-MD5,
CRAM-RIPEMD, CRAM-SHA1, CRAM-SHA224, CRAM-SHA256, CRAM-SHA384, CRAM-SHA512,
CRAM-MD5, LOGIN or PLAIN to use the desired authentication method. You can
disable specific AUTH methods by defining any one more more of the
following environment variables. When using SCRAM authentication, the
secret can be a clear text password or a salted password. The salted
password should be a hex-encoded string (40 characters for SCRAM-SHA-1 and 64
characters for SCRAM-SHA-256) with the user’s PBKDF2-prepared password. The
salted password value can be derived by using the --mkpasswd parameter for
the gsasl(1) utility. indimail has vpasswd(1) / vmoduser(1), which use
gsasl_scram_secrets_from_password(3) API to set passwords for AUTH PLAIN,
LOGIN, CRAM-MD5, CRAM-SHA1, CRAM-SHA224, CRAM-SHA256, CRAM-SHA384,
CRAM-SHA512, CRAM-RIPEMD, DIGEST-MD5, SCRAM-SHA-1, SCRAM-SHA-256 methods.
The hex-encoded salted password can be used to avoid storing a clear-text
credential in the client, however note that an attacker who steal it may
impersonate both a SCRAM client and SCRAM server. If the property is not
available, qmail-remote will ask for the clear text password instead. You
need to set the environment variable \fBSALTED_PASSWORD\fR for qmail-remote
to use the secret as a salted password.

.EX
	DISABLE_AUTH_LOGIN
	DISABLE_AUTH_PLAIN
	DISABLE_CRAM_MD5
	DISABLE_CRAM_SHA1
	DISABLE_CRAM_SHA224
	DISABLE_CRAM_SHA256
	DISABLE_CRAM_SHA384
	DISABLE_CRAM_SHA512
	DISABLE_CRAM_RIPEMD

	DISABLE_SCRAM_SHA1
	DISABLE_SCRAM_SHA256
	DISABLE_SCRAM_SHA1_PLUS
	DISABLE_SCRAM_SHA256_PLUS
.EE

If you set the environment variable \fBSECURE_AUTH\fR, AUTH LOGIN and
AUTH PLAIN gets disabled, unless qmail-remote has opened a TLS session wth
the remote host. See the control file \fIclientcert.pem\fR.

If all connections to the \fIrelay\fR server fail for a \fImax_tolerance\fR
seconds, further connections to the same server are avoided for a period of
at least \fIpenalty\fR seconds. The default maximum period of failures that
will be tolerated - \fImax_tolerance\fR is 120 seconds and the minimum
penalty - \fIpenalty\fR is 1 hour. By setting the \fIpenalty\fR to 0,
connections to the server will be attempted inspite of failures. The
default values of 1 hour for minimum penalty, can be changed by setting the
environment variable \fBMIN_PENALTY\fR. The default value of 120 seconds
for max_tolerance can be changed by setting the environment variable
\fBMAX_TOLERANCE\fR.

.TP 5
.I moresmtproutes.cdb
This file gives smtproutes functionality on a per-user basis. You need to
create \fBmoresmtproutes.cdb\fR file in the following format

.EX
<email_address><sp><ip_address>
.EE

Then run the following command in LIBEXEC directory

.EX
\fBcdbmake-12\fR \fImoresmtproutes\fR.\fIcdb\fR < \fImoresmtproutes\fR.\fItmp\fR < \fImoresmtproutes\fR.\fIcdb\fR
.EE

A route obtained from moresmtproutes.cdb overrides control file
\fBsmtproutes\fR or environment variable \fBSMTPROUTE\fR. One can also
redirect all bounces to a host by specifying

!@<sp><ip_address>

You can override the moresmtproutes.cdb filename by setting environment
variable \fBMORESMTPROUTESCDB\fR.

.TP 5
.I qmtproutes
Additional QMTP routes which have precedence over \fIsmtproutes\fR. QMTP
routes should obey the form \fIdomain\fR:\fIrelay\fR:\fIport\fR, without
any extra spaces. \fIqmtproutes\fR follows the same syntax as
\fIsmtproutes\fR. By default, \fBqmail-remote\fR connects to QMTP service
port 209. However you can chose a dedicated high-port for QMTP
communication as defined in \fIqmtproutes\fR. If the recipient domain is
listed neither in \fIqmtproutes\fR nor in \fIsmtproutes\fR,
\fBqmail-remote\fR will choose the protocol according to MX priority. The
qmtproutes control file is bypassed if the \fBQMTPROUTE\fR environment
variable is set by \fBqmail-rspawn\fR. The \fBQMTPROUTE\fR environment
variable has the same format as the entries in qmtproutes control files. It
is used in a clustered environment where a single domain can exist across
multiple hosts. In such a case the QMTPROUTE variable points to the host
where the user's mailbox lies.

You can override the qmtproutes filename by setting environment variable
\fBQMTPROUTESFILE\fR.

.TP 5
.I timeoutconnect
Number of seconds \fBqmail-remote\fR will wait for the remote SMTP server
to accept a connection. Default: 60. The kernel normally imposes a
75-second upper limit.

.TP 5
.I timeoutremote
Number of seconds \fBqmail-remote\fR will wait for each response from the
remote SMTP server. Default: 1200.

.TP 5
.I signkey
Key for Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV) signing. The filename can be
overriden by the environment variable \fISIGNKEY\fR.

.TP 5
.I nosignhosts
Exclusions of remote hosts for Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV) that do
not work with signed addresses.

Attention: If a host has more that one hostname, please list them all in
\fInosignhosts\fR.

.TP 5
.I nosignmydoms
Exclusions of domains you host for Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV).

.TP 5
.I tlsclientmethod
The TLS protocol list. Accepted values are SSLv23, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1_1,
TLSv1_2, TLSv1_3. The default is TLSv1_2 for OpenSSL Version < 1.0.1.
Without this control file OpenSSL Version >= 1.0.1 uses
TLS_client_method(3ossl) where the actual protocol version used will be
negotiated to the highest version mutually supported by the client and the
server. The supported protocols are SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 and
TLSv1.3. The default location of SYSCONF/control can be overriden by
environment variable \fBCONTROLDIR\fR.

.TP 5
.I tlsclientciphers
A set of OpenSSL client cipher strings. Multiple ciphers contained in a
string should be separated by a colon. The default location of
SYSCONF/control can be overriden by environment variable
\fBCONTROLDIR\fR

.TP 5
.I notlhosts
domains for which \fBqmail-remote\fR will not initiate TLS sesson. This
file in SYSCONF/control or directory defined by the \fBCONTROLDIR\fR
envirnoment variable, shouldn't be confused with \fInotlshosts\fR directory
in the directory defined by the \fBCERTDIR\fR environment variable.

.PP
For TLS sessions, the default location of SYSCONF/control can be
overriden by environment variable CERTDIR. This affects the location of
below files/directories \fIclientcert.pem\fR, \fIservercert.pem\fR,
\fItlshosts/<FQDN>.pem\fR, \fItlshosts/exhaustivelist\fR,
\fInotlshosts/<FQDN>\fR, \fInotlshosts/host\fR.

.TP 5
.I clientcert.pem
SSL certificate that is used to authenticate with the remote server during
a TLS session. If clientcert.pem does not exist, \fBqmail-remote\fR will
not negotiate TLS. The default location of SYSCONF/control can be
overriden by environment variable CERTDIR. \fIclientcert.pem\fR can be
overriden by environment variable \fBCLIENTCERT\fR.

.TP 5
.I tlshosts/<FQDN>.pem
\fBqmail-remote\fR requires TLS authentication from servers for which this
file exists
.RB ( <FQDN>
is the fully-qualified domain name of the remote SMTP server). One of the
.I dNSName
or the
.I CommonName
