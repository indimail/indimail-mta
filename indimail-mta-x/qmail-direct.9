.SH NAME
qmail-direct \- deliver mail message directly to Maildir

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-direct

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBqmail-direct\fR reads a mail message from descriptor 0. It then reads
envelope information from descriptor 1. It places the message directly into
user's Maildir directory. The user is the value of USER environment
variable. For getting the user's Maildir directory, \fBqmail-direct\fR uses
getpwnam(3) from glibc(7). It can use qgetpwnam(3) if the environment
variable USE_QPWGR is set.

The envelope information is an envelope sender address followed by a list
of envelope recipient addresses. The sender address is preceded by the
letter F and terminated by a 0 byte. \fBqmail-direct\fR writes the sender
address as the \fBReturn-Path\fR header. Each recipient address is preceded
by the letter T and terminated by a 0 byte. The list of recipient addresses
is terminated by an extra 0 byte. \fBqmail-direct\fR writes X-Recipients
header as a comma separated list of recipients. If \fBqmail-direct\fR sees
end-of-file before the extra 0 byte, it aborts without delivering the
message.

Every envelope recipient address should contain a username, an @ sign,
and a fully qualified domain name.

\fBqmail-direct\fR always adds a \fBReturn-Path\fR, \fBX-Recipients\fR, and
\fBReceived\fR line to the top of the message. Other than this,
\fBqmail-direct\fR does not inspect the message and does not enforce any
restrictions on its contents. However, the recipients probably expect to
see a proper header, as described in \fBqmail-header\fR(5).

Programs included with qmail which invoke \fBqmail-direct\fR will invoke
the contents of \fBQMAILQUEUE\fR environment variable instead if set.

\fBqmail-direct\fR allows you to deliver mails without requiring costly
services and processes to manage queues and deliveries. It is useful on
single board computers where you might want to conserve the CPU as much
as possible but want mails generated on the system to get delivered to
users.

.SH "EXIT CODES"
\fBqmail-direct\fR does not print diagnostics. It exits 0 if it has
successfully queued the message. It exits between 1 and 99 if it has failed
to queue the message.
