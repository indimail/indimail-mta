.SH NAME
qmail-direct \- deliver mail message directly to Maildir

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-direct
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qmail-direct
reads a mail message from descriptor 0.
It then reads envelope information from descriptor 1. It places the message
directly into user's Maildir directory. The user is the value of USER
environment variable.

The envelope information is an envelope sender address followed by a list
of envelope recipient addresses. The sender address is preceded by the
letter F and terminated by a 0 byte.
.B qmail-direct
writes the sender address as the
.B Return-Path
header. Each recipient address is preceded by the letter T
and terminated by a 0 byte.
The list of recipient addresses is terminated by an extra 0 byte.
If
.B qmail-direct
writes X-Recipients header as a comma separated list of recipients.
If
.B qmail-direct
sees end-of-file before the extra 0 byte, it aborts without delivering the
message.

Every envelope recipient address should contain a username, an @ sign,
and a fully qualified domain name.

.B qmail-direct
always adds a
.BR Return-Path ,
.BR X-Recipients ,
and
.B Received
line to the top of the message.  Other than this,
.B qmail-direct
does not inspect the message and does not enforce any restrictions on its
contents. However, the recipients probably expect to see a proper header,
as described in
.BR qmail-header(5) .

Programs included with qmail which invoke
.B qmail-direct
will invoke the contents of
.B $QMAILQUEUE
instead, if that environment variable is set.

\fBqmail-direct\fR allows you to deliver mails without requiring costly
services and processes to manage queues and deliveries. It is useful on
single board computers where you might want to conserve the CPU as much
as possible but want mails generated on the system to get delivered to
users.

.SH "EXIT CODES"
.B qmail-direct
does not print diagnostics.
It exits
0 if
it has successfully queued the message.
It exits between 1 and 99 if
it has failed to queue the message.
