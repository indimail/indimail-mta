.TH qmail-direct 8
.SH NAME
qmail-direct \- deliver mail message directly to Maildir
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-direct
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qmail-direct
reads a mail message from descriptor 0.
It then reads envelope information from descriptor 1.
It places the message directly into user's maildir. The
user is the entry in passwd(5) that matches the uid of the
process running \fBqmail-direct\fR

The envelope information is
an envelope sender address
followed by a list of envelope recipient addresses.
The sender address is preceded by the letter F
and terminated by a 0 byte.
.B qmail-direct
writes the sender address as the
.B Return-Path
header. Each recipient address is preceded by the letter T
and terminated by a 0 byte.
The list of recipient addresses is terminated by an extra 0 byte.
If
.B qmail-direct
writes X-Recipients header as a comma separated list of recipients.
If
.B qmail-direct
sees end-of-file before the extra 0 byte,
it aborts without delivering the message.

Every envelope recipient address
should contain a username,
an @ sign,
and a fully qualified domain name.

.B qmail-direct
always adds a
.B Received
line to the top of the message.
Other than this,
.B qmail-direct
does not inspect the message
and does not enforce any restrictions on its contents.
However, the recipients probably expect to see a proper header,
as described in
.BR qmail-header(5) .

\fBqmail-direct\fR uses the control file
\fI@controldir@/direct_mail_users\fR.
Only users listed in this file can deliver mails directly to any local user.
\fBqmail-direct\fR will exit with code 55 if user who invokes any of the programs
like sendmail(8), qmail-inject(8), is not listed in this control file

Programs included with qmail which invoke
.B qmail-direct
will invoke the contents of
.B $QMAILQUEUE
instead, if that environment variable is set.

\fBqmail-direct\fB allows you to deliver mails without requiring costly
services and processes to manage queue and delivery. It is usefull on
single board computers where you might want to conserver the CPU as much
as possible but want mails generated on the system to get delivered to a user.

.SH "FILESYSTEM RESTRICTIONS"
.B qmail-direct
imposes two constraints on the queue structure:
each
.B mess
subdirectory must be in the same filesystem as the
.B pid
directory;

.SH "EXIT CODES"
.B qmail-direct
does not print diagnostics.
It exits
0 if
it has successfully queued the message.
It exits between 1 and 99 if
it has failed to queue the message.
