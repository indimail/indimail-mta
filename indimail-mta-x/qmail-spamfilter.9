qmail-spamfilter \- spam filter for indimail

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBqmail-spamfilter\fR [ \fIqqf\fR] \fIarg1\fR] [\fIarg2\fR] ... ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBqmail-spamfilter(8)\fR allows indimail to execute antispam filter. It
gets invoked by indimail programs using qmail-queue frontend when the
\fBQMAILQUEUE\fR environment is defined or when passed as a command line
argument to the qmail-queue frontend.

.EX
QMAILQUEUE=PREFIX/sbin/qmail-spamfilter
.EE

\fBqmail-spamfilter\fR also calls \fBqscanq\fR(8) to perform virus scanning
or bad attachment scan by setting \fBVIRUSCHECK\fR environment variable
between 2 and 7.

\fBqmail-spamfilter\fR uses \fBSPAMFILTER\fR environment variable to
execute the actual spam filter. The \fBSPAMFILTER\fR env variable can
contain command line arguments. The spam filter defined by SPAMFILTER
environment variable should read descriptor 0 and write to descriptor 1.

The sequence in which the filter program is run is given below

.TP 5
1. create a pipe and fork
.TP 5
2. dup write end of the pipe to descriptor 1 in the child and exec the
filter program
.TP 5
3. dup read end of the pipe to descriptor 0 in parent and exec
\fBqmail-queue\fR.
.TP 0

This gives the ability for the SPAMFILTER program to read the mail message
from descriptor 0 before passing it to \fBqmail-queue\fR through the pipe.

\fBqmail-spamfilter\fR will attempt to make the descriptor 0 seekable if
the environment variable \fBMAKE_SEEKABLE\fR is defined. This may be
necessary for certain filter programs like bogofilter which allocate memory
for the mail message when lseek(2) fails.

In this case following interpretations on the exit status will be made

 Exit Status     Interpretation
 -----------     --------------
 0,1,2           Program ran successfully. Interpretation depends
                 on filter implementation. Mail will be accepted
                 unless REJECTSPAM is set. See description below.
 anything else   Mail will be rejected with a temporary error

A typical application of this would be to run spam filtering software like
spamassasin, bogofilter, etc

When the exit code of the filter program matches SPAMEXITCODE, the mail is
considered to be spam.

If \fBREJECTSPAM\fR is set to 1, the mail will be bounced back to the
sender. If \fBNOTIFYSPAM\fR is set, mails will be redirected to the
recipient specified by the \fBNOTIFYSPAM\fR environment variable. If
\fBNOTIFYSPAM\fR is not set, the recipient can be specified by the
\fIglobalspamredirect\fR control file.  The email id in
\fIglobalspamdirect\fR can be overriden by the environment variable
\fBGLOBALSPAMREDIRECT\fR. If both \fBREJECTSPAM\fR and \fBNOTIFYSPAM\fR are
set, spam mails will be bounced back to the sender with a copy redirected
to the recipient specified in by the NOTIFYSPAM environment variable as
well (or the \fBglobalspamredirect\fR control file). you may decide not to
generate a bounce to the sender by setting the environment variable
\fBREJECTSPAM\fR to a value greater than 1 (i.e. black hole SPAM mails).

\fBqmail-spamfilter\fR invokes \fBqmail-multi\fR to deposit the mail. This
can be changed by setting environment variable \fBSPAMQUEUE\fR to the path
of any qmail-queue frontend. It can also be changed by passing the path of
any qmail-queue frontend (along with arguments to the qmail-queue frontend)
on the command line. Passing command line arguments takes precedence
over environment variable.

.SH "EXIT CODES"
\fBqmail-spamfilter\fR does not print diagnostics.
.EX
.\" These codes should be taken from qmail.h
It exits 51 if it cannot allocate memory
It exits 55 if it is not able get the free space for the queue filesystem.
It exits 53 if the free space is below MIN_FREE value.
It exits 60 if it cannot create pipes or dup file descriptors.
It exits 61 if cannot change directory to QMAILHOME
It exits 68 if it cannot create temporary files to make the input seekable.
It exits 75 if cannot exec qscanq.
It exits 120 if it is not able to exec \fBqmail-multi\fR.
It exits 123 if \fBqmail-multi\fR crashes.
