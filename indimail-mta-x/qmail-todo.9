.SH NAME
qmail-todo \- process todo messages from the queue

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBqmail-todo\fR [\-\fId\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBqmail-todo\fR handles todo messages placed into the outgoing queue by
\fBqmail-queue\fR \fBqmail-todo\fR by default looks at QMAILHOME/queue for
messages. This path can be changed by defining the QUEUEDIR environment
variable.

\fBqmail-todo\fR addresses a problem known as the silly qmail (queue)
problem. This problem is found only on system with high injection rates.
qmail with a big local and remote concurrency could deliver a tremendous
amount of messages but normally this can not be achieved because
\fBqmail-send\fR becomes a bottleneck on those high volumes servers.
\fBqmail-send\fR preprocesses all new messages before distributing them for
local or remote delivering. In one run \fBqmail-send\fR does one todo run
but has the ability to close multiple jobs. Because of this layout
\fBqmail-send\fR can not feed all the new available (local/remote) delivery
slots and therefor it is not possible to achieve the maximum throughput.
This would be a minor problem if one \fBqmail-send\fR run could be done in
extreme short time. But because of many file system calls (fsync and
(un)link) a todo run is expensive and throttles the throughput.
\fBqmail-todo\fR solves this by having the todo run done by itself rather
than by \fBqmail-send\fR This reduces the run time in \fBqmail-send.\fR

\fBqmail-todo\fR prepares incoming messages for local and remote delivering
(by creating info/<messid> local/<messid> and remote/<messid> and removing
todo/<messid> See also INTERNALS). Next \fBqmail-todo\fR transmits the
<messid> to qmail-send which will add this message into the priority queue
which schedules the message for delivery. \fBqmail-todo\fR can be optimized
further by making it to transmit the <messids> in chunks rather than every
time a file is found in todo directory. The chunk size can be set by
defining TODO_CHUNK_SIZE

qmail-todo can work in two modes - static queue mode or dynamic queue mode.
The dynamic queue mode is enabled when passed the \-\fId\fR argument by
\fBqscheduler\fR(8).

In dynamic queue mode, qmail-todo wakes up on a message from
\fBqmail-queue\fR(8). If the environment variable \fBDYNAMIC_QUEUE\fR is
set, \fBqmail-queue\fR(8) uses message queue /\fBqmail-queue\fR. If there
is any failure using message queues, \fBqmail-queue\fR(8) reverts back to
using QUEUE/lock/trigger. When in dynamic queue mode, \fBqmail-todo\fR(8)
will also respond to qmail-queue running in static mode whhere
communications happens through \fIQUEUE/lock/trigger\fR. Here \fIQUEUE\fR
refers to the base path of the queue. e.g. /var/indimail/queue/queue1.

In static queue mode, qmail-todo normally does a queue run for every
injected message and then transmits the <messid> to qmail-send which
schedules it for local/remote delivery. If we get too many injections the
queue runs will stall scheduling of local/remote deliveries. Usually we see
a sharp drop in concurrent deliveries while new messages arrive at high
rate in the queue. In such a situation it doesn't make sense to process
the queue after each and every injection. It is more important to fill the
delivery slots with work to drain the queue. The todo run can be adjusted
by setting the environment variable TODO_INTERVAL to have only one queue
run every TODO_INTERVAL seconds. It remembers the last complete queue run
and will just return if we get triggered before last queue run plus
TODO_INTERVAL seconds. If we get triggered before TODO_INTERVAL seconds it
will schedule a forced queue run at last complete queue run plus
TODO_INTERVAL seconds to not miss the new additions to the queue.
TODO_INTERVAL can also be set in the control file \fItodointerval\fR. The
control file takes precedence over the environment variable. If
TODO_INTERVAL=0, TODO_INTERVAL="" or a value less than zero, qmail-todo
silently uses 10 secs as the value for TODO_INTERVAL.

If \fBqmail-todo\fR receives a HUP signal, it will reread \fIlocals\fR,
\fItodointerval\fR, \fIvirtualdomains\fR, \fIenvnoathost\fR,
\fIconf-syncdir\fR, and \fIconf-fsync\fR.

If the environment variable USE_FSYNC is set, then \fBqmail-todo\fR writes
all data to disk ("flushes") all modified in-core data of (i.e., modified
buffer cache pages for) the new message to the disk device (or other
permanent storage device) so that all changed information can be
retrieved even if the system crashes or is rebooted. This includes
writing through or flushing a disk cache if present. The call blocks
until the device reports that the transfer has completed. This is done
for the info and mess files. This can also be set by using \fIconf-fsync\fR
control file.

If the environment variable USE_SYNCDIR is enabled, \fBqmail-send\fR
forces BSD style directory syncing. This can also be set by using
\fIconf-syncdir\fR control file.

\fBqmail-todo\fR can be configured to use a queue with a different split
subdirectory value than compile time value of DIRSPLIT. This can be done by
setting the \fBCONFSPLIT\fR envrionment variable. Additionally, it can
process a queue created with \fItodo\fR, \fIintd\fR with subdirectory split
instead of without any split. This can be done by setting the \fBBIGTODO\fR
environment variable.

The control files conf-syncdir, conf-fsync take precedence over the
environment variable counterparts. If the control conf-fsync, conf-syncdir
are present, \fBqmail-send\fR will additionally set or unset the
environment variables USE_FSYNC, USE_SYNCDIR. This feature is exploited by
\fBqmail-local(8)\fR. The fsync(2) system call is used for doing this.

.SH INTERNALS
Communication between qmail-send and qmail-todo

qmail-todo -> qmail-send
   D[LRB]<mesgid>\\0
    Start delivery for new message with id <messid>.
    the character L, R or B defines the type
    of delivery, local, remote or both respectively.
   L<string>\\0
    Dump string to the logger without adding additional \\n or similar.

qmail-send -> qmail-todo
   H   Got a SIGHUP reread @controldir@/locals and @controldir@/virtualdomains
   X   Quit ASAP.

qmail-todo sends "\\0" terminated messages whereas qmail-send sends just one
character to qmail-todo.
