.TH ifaddr 1
.SH NAME
ifaddr - check if address appears in a field in a message.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ifaddr
.I [ field ... : ] [ addr ... ]
where
.I field
is an 822-format header field and
.I addr
is an email address. If no 
.I field
arguments appear, then 
.B ifaddr
uses
.B To
and 
.B CC

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ifaddr
reads a message from standard input, exiting 0 if any 
.I addr
appears in a 
.I field
header, and exiting 100 if there is no match. Invoked with no addr arguments, 
.B ifaddr
looks for the address in the environment variable $RECIPIENT. Address comparisons are case
insensitive.

If it encounters a temporary error while reading input, 
.B ifaddr
exits 111.

If an address begins with @, then 
.B ifaddr
compares it to the domain portion of addresses from each relevant field.

For example, the .qmail line

 | condtomaildir dir ifaddr to cc from : myfriend

writes correspondence with myfriend to dir.

The invocation

 | condtomaildir dir ifaddr @example.com

writes a message with a To or Cc address in the domain example.com to dir.
