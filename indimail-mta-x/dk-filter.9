.SH NAME
dk-filter \- sign/verify using DKIM (SSP/ADSP optionally) and deliver a
mail message for delivery

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBFILTERARGS=QMAILHOME/bin/dk-filter\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdk-filter\fR is a qfilter which can be set as a filter for
\fBspawn-filter\fR(8) or \fBqmail-qfilter\fR(1). The filter can be set for
\fBspawn-filter\fR(8) either as \fBFILTERARGS\fR or in the control file
\fIfilterargs\fR. The environment variable \fBFILTERARGS\fR takes
precendence over \fIfilterargs\fR control file.

\fBdk-filter\fR supports DKIM signing and verification and can
optionally use \fBSender Signing Practice (SSP)\fR or \fBAuthor Domain
Signing Practice\fR. It uses the libdkim and OpenSSL libraries. To sign a
message, set the \fBDKIMSIGN\fR environment variable to the pathname of the
private key that will be used to sign the message. If there is a %
character in the environment variable, it is removed and replaced by the
domain name in the From: header. If, after substituting the %, that file
does not exist, @controldir@/domainkeys/%/default will be used as the key.
If again, after substituting the % sign, the file does not exist,
@controldir@/domainkeys/default will be used as the key. After all
substitutions, if the key file does not exist, the message will not be
signed. If there is no % and the file does not exist, the message will be
rejected with error 35. The default private key
@controldir@/domainkeys/default can be overriden by the
\fBDKIM_DEFAULT_KEY\fR environment variable.

The selector (s=) will be taken from the basename of the file. The private
key should be created by \fBdknewkey(8)\fR with RSA or ED25519 encryption
method.

You can set various DKIM options in getopt style, by setting the
environment variable DKIMSIGNOPTIONS

.nf
c <canonicalization> r for relaxed [DEFAULT], s - simple,
                     t relaxed/simple, u - simple/relaxed
l                    include body length tag
q                    include query method tag;
t                    include a timestamp tag
h                    include copied headers. This adds the z= tag
                     containing a copy of the message's original
                     headers.
i <identity>         the identity, if not provided it will not be included
x <expire_time>      the expire time in seconds since epoch
                     ( DEFAULT = current time + 604800)
                     if set to - then it will not be included
z <hash>             1 for sha1, 2 for sha256, 3 for both
s <privkeyfile>
y <selector>
.fi

.EX
DKIMSIGNOPTIONS="-c r -q"
sets relaxed canonicalization and include query method tag
.EE

When signing \fBdk-filter\fR uses the domain found in the Return-Path,
Sender, From, X-Bounced-Address headers to set the domain tag. If not it
uses the value of \fBBOUNCEDOMAIN\fR environment variable.
\fBBOUNCEDOMAIN\fR can be set to an email address or a domain (without the
at sign).

In addition to \fBDKIMSIGN\fR environment variable, you can have the domain
and the pathname of the private key in the control file \fIdkimkeys\fR
which has the following format

.EX
domain:private_key_path:envstr
.EE

.fi
Here \fIenvstr\fR is a string of environment variable additions or
removals. e.g.

.EX
QREGEX=1,DKIMSIGNOPTIONS=-z 4
.EX

.fi
If an entry for \fIdomain\fR exists in \fIdkimkeys\fR, the value of
\fBDKIMSIGN\fR environment variable is ignored. You can disable
\fIdkimkeys\fR by setting \fBNODKIMKEYS\fR environment variable.

To verify a message, set the \fBDKIMVERIFY\fR environment variable.
\fBdk-filter\fR always inserts the \fBDKIM-Status\fR header, so that
messages can be rejected later at delivery time, or in the mail reader. In
that case you may set \fBDKIMVERIFY\fR to an empty string. The exit code of
\fBdk-filter\fR can be fine tuned by setting \fBDKIMVERIFY\fR environment
variable. See \fBdkim(8)\fR for a detailed description on setting the
\fBDKIMVERIFY\fR environment variable.

\fBdk-filter\fR does not use any signing practice by default. You can
override this by setting the SIGN_PRACTICE to ssp or adsp (lowercase).

If neither of the environment variables DKIMSIGN, DKIMVERIFY are defined,
dk-filter will do signing by default.

You can set environment variable NODKIM environment variable to disable
DKIM signing and verification, but why would you do that?

\fBdk-filter\fR can insert an additional DKIM-signature if
\fBDKIMSIGNEXTRA\fR is set. This is useful for inserting both RSA and
ED25519 signature when signing. As an example you can have \fBDKIMSIGN\fR
pointing to a RSA private key, \fBDKIMSIGNOPTIONS\fR having "-z 2" along
with other options if any. Additionally set \fBDKIMSIGNEXTRA\fR pointing to
an ed25519 private key and set \fBDKIMSIGNOPTIONSEXTRA\fR to have "-z 4"
along with other options if any.
