.SH NAME
qscanq-stdin \- qmail virus scanner
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBqscanq-stdin\fR [ prog arg1 arg2 arg3 ...  ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBqscanq-stdin\fR is invoked by \fBqscanq\fR. It ensures that the message
on stdin is seekable, extracts its MIME components to the current
directory, and runs the virus / bad attachment scanner on them.

Like \fBqscanq\fR and \fB qmail-queue\fR \fBqscanq-stdin\fR needs no
arguments. If arguments are supplied, they are used as the command to run
instead of \fBqmail-queue\fR.  In this way, further qmail-queue
wrappers--such as spam filters--can be chained with \fBqscanq\fR.

\fBqscanq-stdin\fR expects an email message on file descriptor 1, its
envelope on file descriptor 0, and writes nothing to descriptor 2. It
returns an exit code which is interpreted by the caller (usually
\fBqmail-smtpd\fR or \fBqmail-inject\fR).

The first thing \fBqscanq-stdin\fR does is to copy stdin to a file in the
current directory named "msg". It then closes and reopens the file
read-only on file descriptor 0, and unlinks the file. This presents the
same interface to downstream programs while ensuring that the file is
seekable, read-only, and not directly accessible to other programs.

After making stdin seekable, \fBqscanq-stdin\fR creates a second copy of
the message in a file also named "msg". Some viruses are only detected by
looking at the raw message, so we need a copy in the working folder.

Once stdin is seekable, \fBqscanq-stdin\fR runs \fBRipMIME\fR(1) to extract
the MIME components of stdin into files in the current directory.
\fBRipMIME\fR(1) is run with descriptors 1 and 2 closed, so it can't read
the message envelope or print any output. If \fBRipMIME\fR fails,
\fBqscanq-stdin\fR returns temporary error code 71, resulting in message
deferral. After \fBRipMIME\fR exits, stdin is rewound to the start of the
file.

After \fBRipMIME\fR completes, \fBqscanq-stdin\fR runs bad attachment check
or \fBclamdscan\fR for the virus scanner, depending on the value of
\fBVIRUSCHECK\fR environment variable. The viruscanner can be changed by
setting the \fBSCANCMD\fR environment variable. All three descriptors, 0, 1
and 2, are closed before running run-antivir. If it can't be run, or
crashes, then \fBqscanq-stdin\fR returns code 71, causing the message to be
deferred.

If \fBclamdscan\fR returns code 2, indicating that a virus has been found,
then \fBqscanq-stdin\fR returns error code 33, permanently rejecting the
message. In case the attachment extension matches any prohibited extensions
in the \fIbadext\fR control file,\fBqscanq-stdin\fR will return 34,
permanently rejecting the message

If the virus scanning or bad attachment scanning passes all tests,
\fBqscanq-stdin\fR will run the command supplied on its command line, or if
none is supplied will run \fBqmail-queue\fR. It also requests cleanup of
its working directory by calling \fBrun-cleanq\fR.

Upon startup, \fBqscanq-stdin\fR sets an alarm for the time specified in
conf-ageout (default: 1 hour). When the alarm fires, \fBqscanq-stdin\fR
sends SIGKILL to \fBRipMIME\fR or to the virus scanner, whichever may be
running, and exits with code 71 (or code 54 if \fBripmime\fR is killed).
Once \fBqmail-queue\fR has started (invoked by \fBqmail-queue\fR), it sets
its own alarm, independent of qscanq's alarm (default: 1 day). \fBqscanq\fR
will wait forever if need be, so its longest runtime is equal to
conf-ageout plus the timeout used by \fBqmail-queue\fR

You can set \fBQUEUEPROG\fR environment variable to call something else
instead of \fBqmail-queue\fR.

.SH "CONTROL FILES"

.TP 5
\fIbadext\fR
Unacceptable extensions for attachments. \fBqscanq-stdin\fR will reject
mail if extensions of attachments in the mail matches lines in
\fIbadext\fR. A line in \fIbadext\fR may be of the form .\fIext\fR, meaning
any attachment having the extension \fIext\fR. The filename can be
overriden by the environment variable \fBBADEXT\fR.

.TP 5
\fIbadextpatterns\fR
Gives \fBqscanq-stdin\fR the ability to filter E-Mails by comparing the
attachment extensions  with a REGEX pattern in \fIbadextpatterns\fR. 

Example:
.EX
  *.doc
  !document.doc
  [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]@[0-9][0-9][0-9].doc
  *%*
.EE

\fIbadextpatterns\fR file with this contents stops all mail having
attachment with extension .doc except for document.doc. It also rejects all
mail with extensions like 12345@123.doc. Further, any E-Mail with a sender
address containing a percent sign (%) is rejected. The filename can be
overriden by the environment variable \fBBADEXTPATTERNS\fR.

.SH Environment Variables

\fBqscanq-stdin\fR sets no environment variables. It does pass its
environment to \fBqmail-queue\fR (or \fIprog\fR, if supplied instead). This
means that any qmail-queue wrapper must be able to handle its environment
safely.

If the DEBUG environment variable is set to any value whatsoever, then
\fBqscanq-stdin\fR will print diagnostic messages to stderr whenever an
error occurs. This is for use in debugging a new configuration, and should
never be used to capture "extra log information" during runtime.  If DEBUG
is set for \fBqscanq\fR, then \fBqscanq\fR will set DEBUG=1 when calling
\fBqscanq-stdin\fR.

It should be stressed that the value of DEBUG is ignored. Setting DEBUG to
"1", "TRUE", "yes", etc., will turn on debug messages. Setting it to "0",
"FALSE", "no", "N", etc., will also turn on debug messages. If you don't
want debug messages, don't set DEBUG at all.

The default scanner to be called is set during compilation in conf-scancmd.
This can be overriden at run time by the environment variable
\fBSCANCMD\fR.

You can run \fBqscanq\fR with virus checkers other than \fBclamdscan\fR.
Just edit conf-scancmd with the command-line you want \fBqscanq\fR to use.
The command must obey the following rules:

.LP
.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 2
The current directory is recursively scanned.

.IP \n+[step]
The scanner returns a 0 exit code if directory is clean.

.IP \n+[step]
The scanner returns a 1 exit code if a virus is found.

.IP \n+[step]
The scanner returns a 2 if some runtime error prevented the current
directory from being scanned completely.
.LP

If your scanner's exit codes do not conform to the specification above,
then you will need to provide a wrapper which interprets your scanners
return codes, and returns the above codes.  Then edit conf-scancmd or set
SCANCMD environment variable with the command-line used to run your
wrapper.

.SH Return Codes

In addition to the return codes from
\fBqmail-queue\fR, \fBqscanq-stdin\fR returns 53 (write error) if it can't
create a seekable copy of stdin, and 54 (read error) if it can't reopen
that file in read-only mode or if \fBRipMIME\fR fails. If \fBclamdscan\fR
or \fBqmail-queue\fR fails, it returns code 71 (temporary rejection).
