.SH SYNOPSIS
@libexecdir@/\fBsvwait\fR \fIservice\fR \fIwait_interval\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsvwait\fR waits for a service monitored by supervise(8) to be up and
returns only after the service has been up for more than \fIwait_interval\fR
seconds. It uses svstat(8) command to check the uptime of \fIservice\fR. It
can be used in run files of supervised services which depends on a service
to be up. \fBsvwait\fR writes the status of \fIservice\fR in the file
supervise/status of the service that calls \fBsvwait\fR. This is also displayed
by the svstat command. e.g. here the service /service/inlookup.infifo
has called svwait on /service/mysql.3306.
