.TH ctrlenv 8
.SH NAME
ctrlenv \- runs another program with environment modified, according to a
match in control file having key value pairs, where key can be any address

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBctrlenv\fR [-c] -f \fIfilename\fR [-e \fIenv\fR] -a \fIaddress\fR \fIchild\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBctrlenv\fR(8) supports three formats for \fIfilename\fR.

.IP \[bu] 2
A plain text file without any extension. 
.IP \[bu] 2
A file with .cdb extension. This imples a cdb file created from the plain
text file using \fBcdb-database\fR(8).
.IP \[bu] 2
A file with .sql extension. This implies data to be in MySQL.

.PP
\fIchild\fR consists of one or more arguments. 

\fBctrlenv\fR sets environment variable \fIenv\fR according to the first
matched line for address \fIaddress\fR in the file
\fICONTROL/control/filename\fR It then runs \fIchild\fR.

The matched lines can be in two forms. In the first form, it could be
assignment of multiple environment variables separated by comma.

.EX
addr:envar1=val,envar2=val,envar3=,envar4=val:
.EE

If the matched line contains a line starting wth \fIaddr\fR, the entire
portion of the line following \fIaddr\fR separated by colon ":" is parsed
for variable assignment statements and environment variables can be set or
unset. \fBenv\fR=\fIval\fR adds an environment variable named \fBenv\fR
with value \fIval\fR. \fBenv=\fR unsets an environment variable named
\fBenv\fR, if it exists.

Here \fBenvar1\fR, \fBenvar2\fR, \fBenvar4\fR set to \fIval\fR and
\fBenvar3\fR is unset.

In the second form, it could a value that is assigned to \fIenv\fR passed
on the command line with the -\fBe\fR option.

.EX
addr:val:
.EE

If the matched line contains a line starting wth \fIaddr\fR whose first
word following \fIaddr\fR separated by colon ":" is \fIval\fR,
\fBctrlenv\fR removes an environment variable named \fIenv\fR if one
exists, and then adds an environment variable named \fBenv\fR with value
\fIval\fR.

if \fIenv\fR does not exists, \fBctrlenv\fR adds an environment variable
named \fIenv\fR with value \fIt\fR.

If no matched lines are found, \fBctrlenv\fR runs \fIchild\fR without
modifying any environment variable.

if \fIfilename\fR has a \fB.cdb\fR extension, \fBctrlenv\fR will use
\fBcdb\fR(3) to do a match. You can use \fBcdb-database\fR(8) to convert a
file to cdd format.

if \fIfilename\fR has a \fB.sql\fR extension, \fBctrlenv\fR will use MySQL
table to do a match. You can use sql-database(8) to convert a file to a
table in MySQL.

if -c option is passed on the command line all existing environment
variables will be cleared before running \fIchild\fR.

.SH EXIT CODES
\fBctrlenv\fR exits 111 if it has trouble reading \fIfilename\fR, if it
runs out of memory for environment variables, or if it cannot run
\fIchild\fR. Otherwise its exit code is the same as that of \fIchild\fR.
