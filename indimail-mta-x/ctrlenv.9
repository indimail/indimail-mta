.TH ctrlenv 8
.SH NAME
ctrlenv \- runs another program with environment modified, according to a
match in control file having key value pairs, where key can be any address

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBctrlenv\fR [-c] -f \fIfilename\fR [-e \fIenv\fR] -a \fIaddress\fR \fIchild\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIchild\fR consists of one or more arguments. 

\fBctrlenv\fR sets environment variable \fIenv\fR according to the first matched
line for address \fIaddress\fR in the file \fICONTROL/control/filename\fR
It then runs \fIchild\fR.

The matched lines can be in two forms.
In the first form, it could be assignment of multiple environment variables separated by comma.

.EX
addr:envar1=val,envar2=val,envar3=,envar4=val:
.EE

If the matched line contains a line starting wth \fIaddr\fR, the entire
portion of the line following \fIaddr\fR separated by colon ":" is parsed
for variable assignment statements and environment variables can be set or
unset. \fBenv\fR=\fIval\fR adds an environment variable named \fBenv\fR
with value \fIval\fR. \fBenv=\fR unsets an environment variable named
\fBenv\fR, if it exists.

Here \fBenvar1\fR, \fBenvar2\fR, \fBenvar4\fR set to \fIval\fR and \fBenvar3\fR is unset.

In the second form, it could a value that is assigned to \fIenv\fR. This is when
\fIenv\fR is specified in the command line.

.EX
addr:val:
.EE

If the matched line contains a line starting wth \fIaddr\fR whose first word following
\fIaddr\fR separated by colon ":" is \fIval\fR, \fBctrlenv\fR removes an environment
variable named \fIenv\fR if one exists, and then adds an environment variable named
\fBenv\fR with value \fIval\fR.

if \fIenv\fR does not exists, \fBctrlenv\fR adds an environment variable named
\fIenv\fR with value \fIt\fR.

If no matched lines are found, \fBctrlenv\fR runs \fIchild\fR without
modifying any environment variable

if \fIfilename\fR has a \fB.cdb\fR extension, \fBctrlenv\fR will use
cdb(3) to do a match. You can use cdb-database to convert a file to cdb
form.

if \fIfilename\fR has a \fB.sql\fR extension, \fBctrlenv\fR will use
MySQL table to do a match. You can use sql-database(8) to convert a file
to a table in MySQL

if -c option is passed on the command line all existing environment
variables will be cleared before running \fIchild\fR.

.SH EXIT CODES
\fBctrlenv\fR exits 111 if it has trouble reading \fIfilename\fR, if it
runs out of memory for environment variables, or if it cannot run
\fIchild\fR. Otherwise its exit code is the same as that of \fIchild\fR.
