.SH SYNOPSIS
.B 822addr
\fIfield\fR ...

where
.I field
is an email header name
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B 822addr
reads an 822-format email message from standard input. For each input
header field, 822addr parses the value of the header as an email address and
prints the result to standard output.

The first character of each output line indicates the address type, and the
remainder of the line is the value. A delivery address begins with a plus
\'+\' character, and a comment begins with an open round bracket \'(\'
character.  822addr considers the end of the message or the first line that
cannot be part of an 822-format header field to terminate the message
message body. If it encounters an error while processing a message, 822addr
exits 111.  If no field appears, 822addr looks for to and cc. If 822addr
finds any matching headers, it exits 0. Otherwise, 822addr exits 100.
