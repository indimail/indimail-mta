.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBfilterit\fR is a filter that can be used in \fBdot-qmail\fR(5). It
expects descriptor 0 to be seekable and reads it to get all email headers.
It can be used to deliver mail to a Maildir folder, forward mail to an
address or simply exit with some status when it matches a user-defined
criteria specified on the command line. \fBfilterit\fR can be used to
decide if you want to deliver, deliver to a specific folder, forward to any
email address, drop or bounce the message.

When delivering to a Maildir, \fBfilterit\fR expects \fBHOME\fR,
\fBRPLINE\fR, \fBDTLINE\fR environment variables to be present. If
\fBRPLINE\fR environment variable is not present, it expects \fBSENDER\fR
environment variable to set the \fBRPLINE\fR environment variable and
insert the Return-Path header. If the \fBDTLINE\fR environment variable is
not present, it expects \fBLOCAL\fR, \fBHOST\fR, environment variables to
be present to set the \fBDTLINE\fR environment variable and insert the the
Delivered-To header. This is not a problem when being called from a
\fB.qmail\fR file as \fBqmail-local\fR sets all these environment
variables. But if called from a script that is not executed by qmail-local,
\fBfilterit\fR will exit 100, if these environment variables are not set.
Also, \fBfilterit\fR will exit 100 if it finds the maildir path two
consequent dots. \fIfilterit\fR will create the Maildir if it does not
exist.

When forwarding to an address, \fBfilterit\fR expects \fBNEWSENDER\fR,
\fBDLINE\fR environment variables to be present. If the \fBDTLINE\fR
environment variable is not present, it expects \fBLOCAL\fR, \fBHOST\fR,
environment variables to be present to set the \fBDTLINE\fR environment
variable and insert the the Delivered-To header. This is not a problem when
being called from a \fB.qmail\fR file as \fBqmail-local\fR sets all these
environment variables. But if called from a script that is not executed by
qmail-local, \fBfilterit\fR will exit 100, if these environment variables
are not set. If running as non-root, \fBfilterit\fR uses environment set
according to files in $HOME/.defaultqueue directory. You can skip
$HOME/.defaultqueue if \fBSKIP_LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT\fR is set. If
\fBQUEUE_BASE\fR environment variable is not set, it additionally uses
environment set according to files in @controldir@/defaultqueue
directory (for any uid). When forwarding, \fBfilterit\fR rewrites the
sender using Sender Rewriting Scheme if \fISRS\fB has been configured. See
\fBindimail-srs\fR(5) for information on how to do this.

When bouncing a message (-a bounce -A 100 or -d bounce -D 100), message
will be bounced with the text
.EX
  "message failed to evade local filter(s) set by recipient"
.EE
You can use the -m option to change the bounce message;

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 3
\fB\-n\fR
Do not take any action. Just display the result of filtering

.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Reverse the match. A match becomes no match. No match becomes match

.TP
\fB\-x\fR
Insert X-FilterIT header which shows the filterit invocation arguments and
if a matched occurred

.TP
\fB\-n\fR \fIheader\fR
Use \fIheader\fR to match all headers in a 822-format message.

.TP
\fB\-k\fR \fIkeyword\fR
Use the string \fIkeyword\fR in \fIheader\fR from a 822-format message. The
criteria for a match depends on the type of comparision used (-c option)

.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fIcomparision\fR
Use \fIcomparision\fR as the criteria for deciding a match. This is a
string with one of the following values:
.TS
l l.
Comparision Type             Criteria for match
_
equals                       match happens when header value = keyword
contains                     match happens when header value contains keyword
starts with                  match happens when header value starts with keyword
ends with                    match happens when header value ends with keyword
numerical logical expression Here %p in keyword gets replaced with header
                             value
regexp                       Match happens when a regular expression in
                             keyword matches the header value
.TE

.TP
\fB\-a\fR \fItype\fR -A \fIaction_value\fR
Action to take when there is a match. This has one of the following values:
.TS
l l.
Action type Description
_
exit        Exit with \fIaction_value\fR
forward     Forward to address \fIaction_value\fR
maildir     Deliver to a Maildir \fIaction_value\fR. This has to start with
            './Maildir/' and end with '/' and must not contain two
			consequent dots
.TE

.TP
\fB\-d\fR \fItype\fR -D \fIaction_value\fR
default action to take when there is no match. This has one of the following values:
.TS
l l.
Action type Description
_
exit        Exit with \fIaction_value\fR
forward     Forward to address \fIaction_value\fR
maildir     Deliver to a Maildir \fIaction_value\fR. This has to start with
            './Maildir/' and end with '/' and must not contain two
			consequent dots
.TE

.TP
\fB\-b\fR \fIbounce_message\fR
Set \fIbounce_message\fR as the default bounce message.

.TP
\fB\-e\fR \fIexit_value_on_match\fR
When a match occurs and when \fBfilterit\fR is either doing maildir
delivery or forwarding, \fBfilterit\fR will exit 99 to prevent subsequent
instructions in \fB.qmail\fR to run. Using this changes the default exit
value of \fI99\fR to \fIexit_value_on_match\fR.
