indimail-services \- Overview of IndiMail Services

.SH SYNOPSYS
/service/*

.SH DESCRIPTION
indimail uses various services configured to run under \fBsvscan\fR(8) and
\fBsupervise\fR(8). These services provide SMTP, SMTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, POP3,
POP3S and mail transfer protocols. Apart from the services which provide
the basic protocols, there are few ancillary services needed to run these
protocols.

Detailed below are the services configured for indimail. Each service name
is also a directory in @servicedir@, which has a file named \fIrun\fR and
\fIlog/run\fR. The file \fIrun\fR contains commands to be executed to bring
up the service. The file \fIlog/run\fR usually contains an invocation of
\fBmultilog\fR(8) to log the output of the service to a directory in
@logdir@.
