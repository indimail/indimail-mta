.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdrate\fR(1) displays or sets delivery rate for \fBqmail-remote\fR(8). The actual rate
limiting happens in \fBspawn-filter\fR(8). Hence, QMAILREMOTE should be set to
PREFIX/sbin/spawn-filter. You must also set the environment variable \fBRATELIMIT_DIR\fR
to the full path of the directory where you will keep the rate definition files created by
\fBdrate\fR(1). \fBdrate\fR(1) locks the file \fIdomain\fR in \fIratelimit_dir\fR before
writing the following four lines.

.EX
 line 1 - Rate Expression
 line 2 - Delivery Count since sampling started
 line 3 - Start Time since the sampling started
 line 4 - End   Time of the last sample
.EE

By default, \fBspawn-filter\fR(8) resets statistics one day after the first sample. You can
change the default by setting \fBRATELIMIT_INTERVAL\fR environment variable to the desired
number of seconds. You can manually reset the interval using \fB-R\fR option of
\fBdrate\fR(1).

.SH OPTIONS
.PP

.TP
\fB-t\fR
Run in test mode as if mail is getting delivered. Every invocation will update
the email count and the end time. It will calculate the current rate and return
error with it gets exceeded. This option simulates rate calcuation that happens
during delivery and shouldn't be used on a production system

.TP
\fB-f\fR
Force update email counts and end time.

.TP
\fB-s\fR
Display statistics for deliveries to \fIdomain\fR.

.TP
\fB-d\fR
Use this argument to set the domain name. \fIdomain\fR can be the special word .\fIglobal\fR in case
rate limiting has been applied for all domains that does not have a rate definition. See \fBspawn-filter\fR(8)

.TP
\fB-r\fR
Use this argument to set the rate expression in terms of deliveries/sec. To set a delivery
rate of 500 emails / hr, you can use 500/3600 for the rate expression. You can also give
the prefix '+' or '-' to increase or decrease the existing rate

.TP
\fB-D\fR
The directory to store or retrieve delivery rate parameters and statistics.
If not specified it defaults to CONTROL/ratelimit.

.TP
\fB-c\fR
Consolidate all rate expressions. When you give the '+' or '-' prefix in the
\fIrate_expression\fR, the expressions are simply appended without any mathematical
computation. It is valid to have an expression 1790/3600+10/3600. This option will
collapse the expression to 0.5

.TP
\fB-R\fR
Reset all statistics in \fIratelimit_dir/domain\fR. This will cause \fBqmail-remote\fR(8) to start
counting from start.
