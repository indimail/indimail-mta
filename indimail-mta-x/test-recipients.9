.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtest-recipients\fR(1) tests recipients in indimail's MySQL database or
using recipients extension. The recipients extension in indimail-mta comes
from s/qmail at https://www.fehcom.de/sqmail/sqmail.html.

The \-\fIr\fR option makes \fBtest-recipients\fR do chdir to
\fI@sysconfdir@\fR directory. It then opens the control file recipients from
\fI@controldir@\fR directory. If there are any rules to open a cdb database
in the \fIrecipients\fI control file, it will be opened relative to the
current working directory of \fBqmail-cdb\fR which will be
\fIsysconfdir\fR. You can override \fI@sysconfdir@\fR by setting
\fBSYSCONFDIR\fR environment variable and override \fI@controldir@\fR by
setting \fBCONTROLDIR\fR environment variable.

The \-\fIs\fR option makes \fBtest-recipients\fR loads the indimail.so
shared library for submittig query to \fBinlookup\fR(8) daemon using the
\fBinquery\fR(3) function. The default timeout used to get result from
\fBinlookup\fR(8) daemon is 60 seconds and can be changed by specifying the
\-\fBt\fR \fItimeout\fR argument. Note that to submit query to
\fBinlookup\fR daemon, you will require access to
\fI@indimaildir@/inquery\fR directory owned by \fBindimail:qmail\fR with
\fB0770\fR permissions. You will also require write access to FIFOs in this
directory owned by \fBqmaild:indimail\fR with \fB0660\fR permissions.

\fBqmail-smtpd\fR(8) checks recipients in RCPT TO dialog when the
environment variable \fBCHECKRECIPIENT\fR is set and rejects email when the
recipient is missing. Rejecting emails during SMTP session is better than
accepting it and bouncing it later.

\fBtest-recipient\fR(1) is located in @libexecdir@ directory.

.SH NOTES

The inlookup daemon creates named pipes that can be accessed by
\fBqmaild\fR user. To test users in MySQL it is neccessary to execute it
with the privileges of the user \fBqmaild\fR
