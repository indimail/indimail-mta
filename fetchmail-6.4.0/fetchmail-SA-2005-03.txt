0. Release history
==================

2005-12-19	1.00 - initial version


1. Background
=============

fetchmail is a software package to retrieve mail from remote POP2, POP3,
IMAP, ETRN or ODMR servers and forward it to local SMTP, LMTP servers or
message delivery agents.

fetchmail ships with a graphical, Python/Tkinter based configuration
utility named "fetchmailconf" to help the user create configuration (run
control) files for fetchmail.


2. Problem description and Impact
=================================

Fetchmail contains a bug that causes an application crash when fetchmail
is configured for multidrop mode and the upstream mail server sends a
message without headers.  As fetchmail does not record this message as
"previously fetched", it will crash with the same message if it is
re-executed, so it cannot make progress. A malicious or broken-into
upstream server could thus cause a denial of service in fetchmail
clients.

Note that such messages are not RFC-822 conformant, so if the server has
not been tampered with, the server software is faulty.


3. Workaround
=============

Where possible, singledrop mode may be an alternative.

For sites, where multidrop mode is required, no workaround is known.


4. Solution
===========

Download and install fetchmail 6.3.1 or a newer stable release from
fetchmail's project site at
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/files/>.

The fix has also been backported to the 6.2.5.5 legacy release which is
available from the same site.

Note however that 6.3.X has very few incompatible changes since 6.2.5.X
so 6.3.X should be viable for most sites.  It is therefore recommended
that every user and distributor upgrade to 6.3.1 or newer.


5. End of life announcement
===========================

The fetchmail 6.2.5.X branch will be discontinued early in 2006.

The new 6.3.X stable branch has been available since 2005-11-30
and will not change except for bugfixes, documentation and translations.
