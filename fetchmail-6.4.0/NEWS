# ADVANCE WARNING OF FEATURES TO BE REMOVED OR CHANGED IN FUTURE VERSIONS
(There are no plans to remove features from a 6.3.X release, but they may be
removed from a 6.4.0 or newer release.)
* The MX and host alias DNS lookups that fetchmail performs in multidrop mode
  are based on assumptions that are rarely met in practice, somewhat defective,
  deprecated and may be removed from a future fetchmail version.
  They have never supported IPv6 (including IPv6-mapped IPv4).
  Non-DNS based alias keywords such as "aka" will remain in fetchmail.
* The monitor and interface options may be removed from a future fetchmail
  version as they are not reasonably portable across operating systems.
* POP2 is obsolete, support will be removed from a future fetchmail version.
* IMAP2 and IMAP4 (not IMAP4r1) are obsolete, support may be removed from a
  future fetchmail version.
* RPOP is obsolete, support will be removed from a future fetchmail release.
* --sslcertck will become a default setting in a future fetchmail version.
* The multidrop To/Cc guessing code along with the fragile duplicate suppressor
  is deprecated and may be removed from a future release.
* The "envelope Received" option may be removed from a future release, because
  the Received header was never meant to be machine-readable, the format varies
  widely, and various other differences in behavior make parsing Received an
  unreliable undertaking. The envelope option as such will remain though, in
  order to support Delivered-To, X-Envelope-To, X-Original-To and similar.
  See also <http://home.pages.de/~mandree/mail/multidrop>.
* The --enable-fallback (fall back to MDA if MTA unavailable) will be removed
  from a future fetchmail release, because it makes fetchmail's behavior
  inconsistent and confusing.
* The "protocol auto" default inside fetchmail may be removed from a future
  fetchmail release. Explicit configuration of the protocol is recommended.
* Kerberos IV support may be removed from a future fetchmail release.
* Kerberos 5 support may be removed from a future fetchmail release.
* The --principal option may be removed from a future fetchmail release.
* SIGHUP wakeup support may be removed from a future fetchmail release and
  cause fetchmail to terminate - it was broken for many years.
* Support for operating systems that are not sufficiently POSIX compliant may be
  removed or operation on such systems may be suboptimal for future releases.
  This means that fetchmail may only continue to work on C99 and POSIX 2001
  based systems.
* The maintainer may migrate fetchmail to C++ with STL or C#, and impose further
  requirements (dependencies), such as Boost or other class libraries.
* The softbounce option default will change to "false" in the next release.
* The --bsmtp - mode of operation may be removed in a future release.
* Given that OpenSSL is severely underdocumented, and needs license exceptions,
  fetchmail may switch to a different SSL library.
* SSLv3 support may be removed from a future fetchmail release. It has been
  obsolete for many years and found insecure. Use TLS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

fetchmail-6.4.0 (not yet released):

# NOTE THAT FETCHMAIL IS NO LONGER PUBLISHED THROUGH IBIBLIO.
* They have stopped accepting submissions and consider themselves an archive.

## SECURITY FIXES THAT AFFECT BEHAVIOUR AND MAY REQUIRE RECONFIGURATION
* Fetchmail no longer supports SSLv2.

* Fetchmail no longer attempts to negotiate SSLv3 by default,
  even with --sslproto ssl23. Fetchmail can now use SSLv3, or TLSv1.1 or a newer
  TLS version, with STLS/STARTTLS (it would previously force TLSv1.0 with
  STARTTLS).  If the OpenSSL version used at build and run-time supports these
  versions, --sslproto ssl3 and --sslproto ssl3+ can be used to re-enable SSLv3.
  Doing so is discouraged because the SSLv3 protocol is broken.

  Along the lines suggested - as patch - by Kurt Roeckx, Debian Bug #768843.

  While this change is supposed to be compatible with common configurations,
  users may have to and are advised to change all explicit --sslproto ssl2
  (change to newer protocols required), --sslproto ssl3, --sslproto tls1 to
  --sslproto auto, so that they can benefit from TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 where
  supported by the server.

  The --sslproto option now understands the values auto, ssl3+, tls1+, tls1.1,
  tls1.1+, tls1.2, tls1.2+, tls1.3, tls1.3+ (case insensitively), see CHANGES
  below for details.

* Fetchmail defaults to --sslcertck behaviour. A new option --nosslcertck to
  override this has been added, but may be removed in future fetchmail versions
  in favour of another configuration option that makes the insecurity in using
  this option clearer.

## SECURITY FIXES
* Fetchmail prevents buffer overruns in GSSAPI authentication with user names
  beyond c. 6000 characters in length. Reported by Greg Hudson.

## CHANGES
* fetchmail 6.3.X is unsupported.
* fetchmail now requires OpenSSL v1.0.2 or newer.
* fetchmail now configures OpenSSL support by default.
* Fetchmail now supports --sslproto auto and --sslproto tls1+ (same as ssl23).
* --sslproto tls1.1+ and tls1.2+ are now supported for auto-negotiation with a
  minimum specified TLS protocol version, and --sslproto tls1.1 and --sslproto
  tls1.2 to force the specified TLS protocol version.
* Fetchmail now detects if the server hangs up prematurely during SSL_connect()
  and reports this condition as such, and not just as SSL connection failure.
  (OpenSSL 1.0.2 reported incompatible with pop3.live.com by Jerry Seibert).
* A foreground fetchmail can now accept a few more options while another copy is
  running in the background.
* fetchmail now handles POP3 --keep UID lists more efficiently, by using Rainer
  Weikusat's P-Tree implementation. This reduces the complexity for handling
  a large UIDL from O(n^2) to O(n log n) and becomes noticably faster with
  thousands of kept messages. (IMAP does not track UIDs and is unaffected.)
  At the same time, the UIDL emulation code for deficient servers has been
  removed. It never worked really well.  Servers that do not implement the
  optional UIDL command only work with --fetchall option set, which in itself is
  incompatible with the --keep option (it would cause message duplication).

## FIXES
* Fix a typo in the FAQ. Submitted by David Lawyer, Debian Bug#706776.
* Do not translate header tags such as "Subject:".  Reported by Gonzalo Pérez de
  Olaguer Córdoba, Debian Bug#744907.
* Convert most links from berlios.de to sourceforge.net.
* Report error to stderr, and exit, if --idle is combined with multiple
  accounts.
* Point to --idle from GENERAL OPERATION to clarify --idle and multiple
  mailboxes do not mix.  In response to Jeremy Chadwick's trouble 2014-11-19,
  fetchmail-users mailing list.
* Fix SSL-enabled build on systems that do not declare SSLv3_client_method(),
  or that #define OPENSSL_NO_SSL3 inside #include <openssl/ssl.h>
  Related to Debian Bug#775255. Fixes Debian Bug #804604.
* Version report lists -SSLv3 on SSL-enabled no-ssl3 builds.
* Fetchmail no longer adds a NUL byte to the username in GSSAPI authentication.
  This was reported to break Kerberos-based authentication with Microsoft
  Exchange 2013 by Greg Hudson.

# KNOWN BUGS AND WORKAROUNDS
  (This section floats upwards through the NEWS file so it stays with the
  current release information)
* Fetchmail does not handle messages without Message-ID header well
  (See sourceforge.net bug #780933)
* BSMTP is mostly untested and errors can cause corrupt output.
* Sun Workshop 6 (SPARC) is known to miscompile the configuration file lexer in
  64-bit mode.  Either compile 32-bit code or use GCC to compile 64-bit
  fetchmail.  Note that fetchmail doesn't take advantage of 64-bit code,
  so compiling 32-bit SPARC code should not cause any difficulties.
* Fetchmail does not track pending deletes across crashes.
* The command line interface is sometimes a bit stubborn, for instance,
  fetchmail -s doesn't work with a daemon running.
* Linux systems may return duplicates of an IP address in some circumstances if
  no or no global IPv6 addresses are configured.
  (No workaround. Ubuntu Bug#582585, Novell Bug#606980.)
* Kerberos 5 may be broken, particularly on Heimdal, and provide bogus error
  messages. This will not be fixed, because the maintainer has no Kerberos 5
  server to test against. Use GSSAPI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

fetchmail-6.3.26 (released 2013-04-23, 26180 LoC):

# CRITICAL BUG FIX for setups using "mimedecode":
* The mimedecode feature failed to ship the last line of the body if it was
  encoded as quoted-printable and had a MIME soft line break in the very last
  line.  Reported by Lars Hecking in June 2011.

  Bug introduced on 1998-03-20 when the mimedecode support was added by ESR
  before release 4.4.1 through code contributed by Henrik Storner.
  Workaround for older releases: do not use mimedecode feature.

  Earlier versions of this NEWS file claimed this bug fixed in fetchmail-6.3.23,
  but it was not.

  Fixes Launchpad Bug#1171818.


fetchmail-6.3.25 (released 2013-03-18, 26149 LoC):

# BUG FIXES
* Fix a memory leak in out-of-memory error condition while handling plugins.
  Report and patch by John Beck (found with Parfait static code analyzer).
* Fix a NULL pointer dereference in out-of-memory error condition while handling
  plugins.
  Report and patch by John Beck (found with Parfait static code analyzer).

# CHANGES
* Improved reporting when SSL/TLS X.509 certificate validation has failed,
  working around a not-so-recent swapping of two OpenSSL error codes, and
  a practical impossibility to distinguish broken certification chains from
  missing trust anchors (root certificates).
* OpenSSL decoded errors are now reported through report(), rather than dumped
  to stderr, so that they should show up in logfiles and/or syslog.
* The fetchmail manual page no longer claims that MD5 were the default OpenSSL
  hash format (for use with --sslfingerprint). Reported by Jakob Wilk,
  PARTIAL fix for Debian Bug#700266.
* The fetchmail manual page now refers the user to --softbounce from the
  SMTP/ESMTP ERROR HANDLING section.  Reported by Anton Shterenlikht.

# WORKAROUNDS
* Older systems that provide the older RFC-2553 implementation of getaddrinfo,
  rather than the current RFC-3493, and systems that do not provide this
  getaddrinfo() interface at all and thus use the replacement functions from
  libesmtp/getaddrinfo.?, might return EAI_NODATA when a host is registered in
  DNS as MX or similar, but without A or AAAA records.  Handle this situation
  when checking for multidrop aliases and treat EAI_NODATA the same as
  EAI_NONAME, i. e. name cannot be resolved.

  The proper fix, however, is to upgrade the operating system.

fetchmail-6.3.24 (released 2012-12-23, 26108 LoC):

# CRITICAL AND REGRESSION FIXES
* Plug a memory leak in OpenSSL's certificate verification callback.
  This would affect fetchmail configurations running with SSL in daemon mode
  more than one-shot runs.
  Reported by Erik Thiele, and pinned by Dominik Heeg,
  fixes Debian Bug #688015.
  This bug was introduced into fetchmail 6.3.0 (committed 2005-10-29)
  when support for subjectAltName was added through a patch by Roland
  Stigge, submitted as Debian Bug#201113.

* The --logfile option now works again outside daemon mode, reported by Heinz
  Diehl. The documentation that I had been reading was inconsistent with the
  code, and only parts of the manual page claimed that --logfile was only
  effective in daemon mode.


fetchmail-6.3.23 (released 2012-12-10, 26106 LoC):

# REGRESSION FIXES
* Fix compilation with OpenSSL implementations before 0.9.8m that lack
  SSL_CTX_clear_options. Patch by Earl Chew.
  Note that the use of older OpenSSL versions with fetchmail is unsupported and
  *not* recommended.

# BUG FIXES
* Fix combination of --plugin and -f -. Patch by Alexander Zangerl,
  to fix Debian Bug#671294.
* Clean up logfile vs. syslog handling, and in case logfile overrides
  syslog, send a message to the latter stating where logging goes.

# CHANGES
* The build process can now be made a bit more silent and concise through
  ./configure --enable-silent-rules, or by adding "V=0" to the make command.

# WORKAROUNDS
* Make Maillennium POP3 workarounds less specific, to encompass
  Maillennium POP3/UNIBOX (Maillennium V05.00c++). Reported by Eddie
  via fetchmail-users mailing list, 2012-10-13.

fetchmail-6.3.22 (released 2012-08-29, 26077 LoC):

# SECURITY FIXES
* for CVE-2012-3482:
  NTLM: fetchmail mistook an error message that the server sent in response to
  an NTLM request for protocol exchange, tried to decode it, and crashed while
  reading from a bad memory location.
  Also, with a carefully crafted NTLM challenge packet sent from the server, it
  would be possible that fetchmail conveyed confidential data not meant for the
  server through the NTLM response packet.
  Fix: Detect base64 decoding errors, validate the NTLM challenge, and abort
  NTLM authentication in case of error.
  See fetchmail-SA-2012-02.txt for further details.
  Reported by J. Porter Clark.

* for CVE-2011-3389:
  SSL/TLS (wrapped and STARTTLS): fetchmail used to disable a countermeasure 
  against a certain kind of attack against cipher block chaining initialization 
  vectors (SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS).
  Whether this creates an exploitable situation, depends on the server and the 
  negotiated ciphers.
  As a precaution, fetchmail 6.3.22 enables the countermeasure, by clearing 
  SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS.

  NOTE that this can cause connections to certain non-conforming servers to 
  fail, in which case you can set the environment variable 
  FETCHMAIL_DISABLE_CBC_IV_COUNTERMEASURE to any non-empty value when starting
  fetchmail to re-instate the compatibility option at the expense of security.

  Reported by Apple Product Security.

  For technical details, refer to <http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt>.
  See fetchmail-SA-2012-01.txt for further details.

# BUG FIX
* The Server certificate: message in verbose mode now appears on stdout like the
  remainder of the output. Reported by Henry Jensen, to fix Debian Bug #639807.

* The GSSAPI-related autoconf code now matches gssapi.c better, and uses
  a different check to look for GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE.
  This fixes the GSSAPI-enabled build on NetBSD 6 Beta.

# CHANGES
* On systems where SSLv2_client_method isn't defined in OpenSSL (such as
  newer Debian, and Ubuntu starting with 11.10 oneiric ocelot), don't
  reference it (to fix the build) and if configured, print a run-time error 
  that the OS does not support SSLv2. Fixes Debian Bug #622054,
  but note that that bug report has a more thorough patch that does away with
  SSLv2 altogether.

* The security and errata notices fetchmail-{EN,SA}-20??-??.txt are now
  under the more relaxed CC BY-ND 3.0 license (the noncommercial clause
  was dropped). The Creative Commons address was updated.

* The Python-related Makefile.am parts were simplified to avoid an automake
  1.11.X bug around noinst_PYTHON, Automake Bug #10995.

* Configuring fetchmail without SSL now triggers a configure warning,
  and asks the user to consider running configure --with-ssl.

# WORKAROUND
* Some servers, notably Zimbra, return A1234 987 FETCH () in response to
  a header request, in the face of message corruption.  fetchmail now treats
  these as temporary errors. Report and Patch by Mikulas Patocka, Red Hat.

* Some servers, notably Microsoft Exchange, return "A0009 OK FETCH completed."
  without any header in response to a header request for meeting reminder
  messages (with a "meeting.ics" attachment). fetchmail now treats these as
  transient errors.  Report by John Connett, Patch by Sunil Shetye.

fetchmail-6.3.21 (released 2011-08-21, 26011 LoC):

# CRITICAL BUG FIX
* The IMAP client no longer inserts NUL bytes into the last line of a message
  when it is not closed with a LF or CRLF sequence. Reported by Antoine Levitt.
  As a side effect of the fix, and in order to avoid a full rewrite, fetchmail
  will now CRLF-terminate the last line fetched through IMAP, even if it is
  originally not terminated by LF or CRLF. This bears no relevance if your
  messages end up in mbox, but adds line termination for storages (like Maildir)
  that do not require that the last line be LF- or CRLF-terminated.

# CONTRIB/ addition
* There is a patch against fetchnews's source, contrib/rawlog.patch, that can
  log (and hexdump non-printing characters) raw socket data to a file. It proved
  useful to debug Antoine's bug described above.


fetchmail-6.3.20 (released 2011-06-06, 26005 LoC):

# SECURITY BUG FIXES
* CVE-2011-1947:
  STARTTLS: Fetchmail runs the IMAP STARTTLS or POP3 STLS negotiation with the
  set timeout (default five minutes) now. This was reported missing, with
  observed fetchmail freezes beyond a week, by Thomas Jarosch.
     SSL-wrapped connections were unaffected by this timeout, so users of older
  versions can force ssl-wrapped connections -- if supported by the server --
  with the --ssl command line or ssl rcfile option.
  See fetchmail-SA-2011-01.txt for further details.

# BUG FIXES
* IMAP: Do not search for UNSEEN messages in ranges. Usually, there are very few
  new messages and most of the range searches result in nothing. Instead, split
  the long response to make the IMAP driver think that there are multiple lines
  of response. (Sunil Shetye)
* Do not print "skipping message" for old messages even in verbose mode. If
  there are too many old messages, the logs just get filled without any real
  activity. (Sunil Shetye) (suggested by Yunfan Jiang)
* Build: fetchmail now always uses its own MD5 implementation rather than trying
  to find a system library with matched header. The library and header variants
  found on systems are too diverse, and the code size saving is not worth any
  more wasted user or programmer time.

# CHANGES
* Call strlen() only once when removing CRLF from a line. (Sunil Shetye)
* fetchmail sets Internet domain sockets to "keepalive" mode now. Note that
  there is no portable way to configure actual timeouts for this mode, and some
  systems only support a system-wide timeout setting. fetchmail does not
  attempt to tune the time spans of keepalive mode.

fetchmail-6.3.19 (released 2010-12-10, 25945 LoC):

# ERRATUM NOTICE ISSUED
* fetchmail 6.3.18 contains several bug fixes that were considered sufficiently
  grave to warrant the issue of an erratum notice, fetchmail-EN-2010-03.txt.

# BUG FIXES
* When specifying multiple local multidrop lists, do not lose wildcard flag.
  (Affects "user foo is bar baz * is joe here")
* In multidrop configurations, an asterisk can now appear anywhere in the list
  of local users, not just at the end.
* In multidrop mode, header parsing is now more verbose in -vv mode, so that it
  becomes possible to see which header is used.
* Make --antispam work from command line (these used to work in rcfiles).
  Reported by Kees Bakker, BerliOS Bug #17599. (Sunil Shetye)
* Smoke test XHTML 1.1 validation, and if it fails, skip validating HTML
  documents.  Skip validating Mailbox-Names-UTF7.html. Several systems have
  broken XHTML 1.1 DTD installations that jeopardize the build.
  Reported by Mihail Nechkin against FreeBSD port.
  Workaround for 6.3.18: build in a separate directory, i. e:
  mkdir build && cd build && ../configure --options-go-here
* Send a NOOP only after a failed STARTTLS in IMAP. (Sunil Shetye)
* Demote GSSAPI verbose/debug syslog to INFO severity. Requested by Carlos E. R.
  and Derek Simkowiak via the fetchmail-users@ mailing list.
* Do STARTTLS/STLS negotiation in IMAP/POP3 if it is mandatory even if the
  server capabilities do not show support for upgradation to TLS.
  To use this, configure --sslproto tls1. (Sunil Shetye)
* IMAP: Understand empty strings as FETCH response, seen on Yahoo. Reported by
  Yasin Malli to fetchmail-users@ 2010-12-10.
  Note that fetchmail continues to expect literals as FETCH response for now.

# DOCUMENTATION
* The manual page now links to IANA for GSSAPI service names.

fetchmail-6.3.18 (released 2010-10-09, 25936 LoC):

# SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS TO DEFANG X.509 CERTIFICATE ABUSE
* Fetchmail now only accepts wildcard certificate common names and subject
  alternative names if they start with "*.". Previous versions would accept
  wildcards even if no period followed immediately.
* Fetchmail now disallows wildcards in certificates to match domain literals
  (such as 10.9.8.7), or wildcards in domain literals ("*.168.23.23").
  The test is overly picky and triggers if the pattern (after skipping the
  initial wildcard "*") or domain consists solely of digits and dots, and thus
  matches more than needed.
* Fetchmail now disallows wildcarding top-level domains.

# CRITICAL BUG FIXES AND REGRESSION FIXES
* Fetchmail 6.3.15, 6.3.16, and 6.3.17 would pick up libmd5 to obtain MD5*
  functions, as an effect of an undocumented Solaris MD5 fix.
  This caused all MD5-related functions to malfunction if, for instance,
  libmd5.so was installed on other operating systems as part of libwww on
  machines where long isn't 32-bits, i. e. usually on 64-bit computers.
  Fixes Gentoo Bug #319283, reported, including libwww hint, by Karl Hakimian.
  Side effect: fetchmail will now use -lmd on Solaris rather than -lmd5.
* Fetchmail 6.3.17 warned about insecure SSL/TLS connections even if a matching
  --sslfingerprint was specified. This is an omission from an SSL usability
  change made in 6.3.17.
  Fixes Debian Bug#580796 reported by Roland Stigge.
* Fetchmail will now apply timeouts to the authentication stage.
  This stage encompasses STARTTLS/STLS negotiation in IMAP/POP3.
  Reported missing by Thomas Jarosch.
* Fetchmail now cancels GSSAPI authentication properly when encountering GSS
  errors, such as no or unsuitable credentials.
  It now sends an asterisk on a line by its own, as required in SASL.
    This fixes protocol synchronization issues that cause Authentication
  failures, often observed with kerberized MS Exchange servers.
  Fixes Debian Bug #568455 reported by Patrick Rynhart, and Alan Murrell, to the
  fetchmail-users list. Fix verified by Thomas Voigtmann and Patrick Rynhart.

# BUG FIXES
* Fetchmail will no longer print connection attempts and errors for one host
  in "silent" and "normal" logging modes, unless all connections fail. This
  should reduce irritation around refused-connection logging if services are
  only on an IPv4 socket if the host also supports IPv6. Often observed as
  connections refused to ::1/25 when the subsequent connection to 127.0.0.1/25
  then - silently - succeeds.  Fetchmail, unless in verbose mode, will collect
  all connect errors and only report them if all of them fail.
* Fetchmail will not try GSSAPI authentication automatically, unless it has GSS
  credentials. However, if GSSAPI authentication is requested explicitly,
  fetchmail will always try it.
* Fetchmail now parses response to "FETCH n:m RFC822.SIZE" and "FETCH n
  RFC822.HEADER" in a more flexible manner. (Sunil Shetye)
* The manual page clearly states that --principal is for Kerberos 4 only, not
  for Kerberos 5 or GSSAPI. Found by Thomas Voigtmann.

# CHANGES
* When encountering incorrect headers, fetchmail will refer to the bad-header
  option in the manpage.
  Fixes BerliOS Bug #17272, change suggested by Björn Voigt.
* Fetchmail now decodes and reports GSSAPI status codes upon errors.
* Fetchmail now autoprobes NTLM also for POP3.
* The Fetchmail FAQ has a new item #R15 on authentication failures.

# INTERNAL CHANGES
* The common NTLM authentication code was factored out from pop3.c and imap.c.

fetchmail-6.3.17 (released 2010-05-06, 25767 LoC):

# SECURITY FIX
* CVE-2010-1167: Fetchmail before release 6.3.17 did not properly sanitize
  external input (mail headers and UID). When a multi-character locale (such as
  UTF-8) was in use, this could cause memory exhaustion and thus a denial of
  service, because fetchmail's report.c functions assumed that non-success of
  [v]snprintf was due to insufficient buffer size allocation. It would then
  repeatedly reallocate a larger buffer and fail formatting again.
  See fetchmail-SA-2010-02.txt.

# FEATURES
* Fetchmail now supports a --sslcertfile <file> option to specify a "CA bundle"
  file (a file that contains trusted CA certificates). Since these bundled CA
  files do not require c_rehash to be run, they are easier to use and immune to
  OpenSSL library updates that affect the hash function.
* Fetchmail now supports a FETCHMAIL_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_X509_CA_CERTS
  environment variable to force loading the default SSL CA certificate
  locations even if --sslcertfile or --sslcertpath is used.
  If neither option is in effect, fetchmail loads the default locations.

# REGRESSION FIX
* Fix string handling in rcfile scanner, which caused fetchmail to misparse a
  run control file in certain circumstances.  Fixes BerliOS bug #14257.
  Patch by Michael Banack.  This fixes a regression introduced before 6.3.0.

# BUG FIXES
* Plug memory leak when using a "defaults" entry in the run control file.
* Do not print SSL certificate mismatches unless verbose or --sslcertck is
  enabled.
* Do not lose "set invisible" in fetchmailconf. (Michael Barnack)

# CHANGES
* Usability: SSL certificate chains are fully printed in -v -v mode, and there
  are now helpful pointers to --sslcertpath and c_rehash for "unable to get
  local issuer certificate" and self-signed certificates -- these usually hint
  to missing root signing CAs in the certs directory.
* Several fixes for compiler (GCC, Intel C++, CLang) and autotools warnings
* Memory allocation failures will now cause abnormal program abort (SIGABRT),
  no longer an exit with unspecified code.
* Print a warning if certificate verification failed and the user did not
  specify --sslcertck.

# DOCUMENTATION
* Fix table of global option to read "set softbounce" where there used to be a
  2nd copy of "set spambounce".  Patch by Michael Banack, BerliOS Bug #17067.
* In the --sslcertpath description, mention that OpenSSL upgrade (and a 0.9.X
  to 1.0.0 upgrade in particular) may require running c_rehash.

fetchmail-6.3.16 (released 2010-04-06, 25574 LoC):

# BUG FIX
* Fix --interface option, broken in 6.3.15. Reported by Vladmimir Stavrinov.
  Fixes Debian Bug #576717.

# CHANGE
* Call OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms(). This is needed to support non-mandatory
  and non-standard algorithms in certificates.
  Sjoerd Simons, to fix Debian Bug #576430.
  OpenSSL 0.9.8* does not load - for instance - the SHA256 digest by default.
  Reported as OpenSSL RT#2224.


fetchmail-6.3.15 (released 2010-03-28, 25572 LoC):

# FEATURE
* Fetchmail now supports a bad-header command line or rcfile option that takes
  exactly one argument, accept or reject (default).  This specifies how messages
  with bad headers retrieved from the current server are to be treated.

# BUG FIXES
* In the rcfile, recognize "local" as abbreviation for "localdomains", as
  documented. The short form has not ever worked since this feature was added in
  January 1997. Reported by Frédéric Marchal.
* Do not close stdout when using mda and "bsmtp -" at the same time.
* Log operating system errors when BSMTP writes fail.
* Fix verbose mode progress formatting regression from 6.3.10; SMTP trace lines
  were no longer on a line of their own. Reported by Melchior Franz.
* Check seteuid() return value and abort running MDA if switch fails.
* Set global flags in a consistent manner. Make --nosoftbounce and
  --nobounce work from command line (these used to work in rcfiles).
  Reported and fix confirmed working by N.J. Mann. (Sunil Shetye)
* Properly import h_errno declarations, even on systems where h_errno isn't a
  macro. (Adds ./configure check, fixes Cygwin dllimport warnings.)

# CHANGES
* The repository has been converted and moved from the Subversion (SVN) format
  kindly hosted by Graham Wilson over the past years to Git format hosted on
  Gitorious.org.  My deepest thanks to Graham Wilson for this service that
  kept us going when BerliOS's Subversion service was faulty in its early days.
* This opportunity was used to convert BRANCH_6-2 and BRANCH_1-9-9 to
  GnuPG-signed tags, as a sign that these are now closed.
* The outdated SVN trunk is now called "oldtrunk" in Git just to save the work
  for future reference. All development in the past few years was on BRANCH_6-3.
* master was branched from BRANCH_6-3.  BRANCH_6-3 is now obsolete (and in fact
  was also converted to a tag to record where the conversion from SVN to Git
  took place).
* "make check" now skips HTML validation if xmllint or XHTML DTD are missing.

# DOCUMENTATION
* Web site and documentation were adjusted to reflect the SVN->Git move.
* The fetchmail manual page is now much clearer on the user id switching
  (seteuid) when using --mda while running as the super user.

fetchmail 6.3.14 (released 2010-02-05, 25487 LoC):

# SECURITY FIXES
* CVE-2010-0562: SSL/TLS certificate information is now also reported properly
  on computers that consider the "char" type signed. Fixes malloc() buffer
  overrun.  Workaround for older versions: do not use verbose mode.
  See fetchmail-SA-2010-01.txt for details, including a minimal patch.

# BUG FIXES
* The IMAP client no longer skips messages from several IMAP servers including
  Dovecot if fetchmail's "idle" is in use.  Causes were that fetchmail (a)
  ignored some untagged responses when it should not (b) relied on EXISTS
  messages in response to EXPUNGE, which aren't mandated by RFC-3501 (the IMAP
  standard) and aren't sent by Dovecot either.
    Fix by Sunil Shetye (the fix also consolidates IMAP response handling,
  improving overall robustness of the IMAP client), bug report and testing by
  Matt Doran, with further hints from Timo Sirainen.
* The SMTP client now recovers from errors (such as servers dropping the
  connection after errors) when sending an RSET command.
    Fix by Sunil Shetye. Report by James Moe.
* The IMAP client now uses "SEARCH UNSEEN" rather than "SEARCH UNSEEN NOT
  DELETED" again on IMAP2, to fix a regression in fetchmail 6.2.5 reported by
  Will Stringer in June 2004. (Sunil Shetye)
* The IMAP client now uses "SEARCH UNSEEN UNDELETED" on IMAP4 and IMAP4r1
  servers (Sunil Shetye).
* Workaround: The IMAP client now falls back to "FETCH n:m FLAGS" if the server
  does not support "SEARCH". (Sunil Shetye)
* The IMAP client now requests message numbers in batches of 1,000 to avoid
  problems if there are more than 1860 unseen messages. (Sunil Shetye)
    Note that this wasn't security relevant because fetchmail would only read up
  to the maximum buffer size and leave the remainder of the string unread, going
  out of synch afterwards.
* Stricter validation of IMAP responses containing byte or message counts.

# CHANGES
* Only include gssapi.h if we're not including gssapi/gssapi.h, to fix a FreeBSD
  compiler warning about gssapi.h being obsolete.

# DOCUMENTATION
* The README.SSL document was revised for grammar, spelling, and clarity.

fetchmail 6.3.13 (released 2009-10-30, 25333 LoC):

# REGRESSION FIXES
* The multiline SMTP error fix in release 6.3.12 caused fetchmail to lose
  message codes 400..599 and treat all of these as temporary error. This would
  cause messages to be left on the server even if softbounce was turned off.
  Reported by Thomas Jarosch.

fetchmail 6.3.12 (released 2009-10-05):

# REGRESSION FIXES
* The CVE-2009-2666 fix in fetchmail release 6.3.11 caused a free() of
  unallocated memory on SSL connections, which caused crashes or program aborts
  on some systems (depending on how initialization and free() of unallocated
  memory is handled in compiler and libc).
  Workaround for older versions: run in verbose mode.
  Patch courtesy of Thomas Heinz, fixes Gentoo Bug #280760.
  This regression affected only the 6.3.11 release, but not the patch that was
  part of the security announcement fetchmail-SA-2009-01.

# BUG FIXES
* Fix error reporting for GSSAPI on Heimdal (h5l) Kerberos.
* Look for MD5_Init in libcrypto rather than libssl, fixes Gentoo Kerberos
  builds; fixes upstream parts of Gentoo Bugs #231400 and #185652, and fixes
  BerliOS Bug #16134.
* Report multiline SMTP errors properly, reported by Earl Chew; fixes Debian Bug
  #529899, reported by Akihiro Terasaki.
  Note: This fix introduced a regression, fixed in 6.3.13.
* Replace control characters in SMTP replies by '?'.
* Fetchmailconf: Fix descriptions for smtpaddress and smtpname options;
  smtpaddress is for RCPT TO, not MAIL FROM. Found by Gerard Seibert.

fetchmail 6.3.11 (released 2009-08-06):

# SECURITY BUGFIXES
* CVE-2009-2666: SSL NUL prefix impersonation attack through NULs in a
  part of a X.509 certificate's CommonName and subjectAltName fields. These
  fields use opaque strings with a separate length field, so that the NUL
  character isn't a special character inside the certificate. Fetchmail, being
  written in the C language, used to treat these strings as C strings
  nonetheless, so that the domain comparison would end at the first embedded NUL
  character, rather than at the real end of the string.
    Fetchmail will now abort certificate verification as failed if NULs are
  encountered inside either of these fields regardless of their position, and
  drop the connection even if --sslcertck is not used, because NUL is not a
  valid character in legitimate DNS names.
  See fetchmail-SA-2009-01.txt for details, including a minimal patch.

# BUGFIXES
* Remove the spurious message "message delimiter found while scanning headers".
  RFC-5322 syntax states that the delimiter is part of the body, and the body is
  optional.
* Convert all non-printable characters in certificate Subject/Issuer
  Common Name or Subject Alternative Name fields to ANSI-C hex escapes (\xnn,
  where nn are hex digits).
  Note that this change introduces a regression, fixed in 6.3.12.
  See the 6.3.12 documentation above for details and a workaround.

fetchmail 6.3.10 (released 2009-07-02):

# INCOMPATIBLE BUGFIXES AND CHANGES
* Fetchmail no longer drops permanently undelivered messages by default, to
  match historic documentation.  It does this by adding a new "softbounce"
  option, see below.
  Fixes Debian Bug#471283, demotes Debian Bug#494418 to wishlist.
* There is a new "softbounce" global option that prevents the deletion of
  messages that have not been forwarded. It defaults to "true" for fetchmail
  6.3.X in order to match historic documentation. This may change its default
  in the next major release.

# BUGFIXES
* Fix misuse of canonical autoconf target as _TARGET when it should have been
  _HOST. Report and patch courtesy of Diego E. "Flameeyes" Pettenò.
  Details: http://blog.flameeyes.eu/2009/01/01/the-canonical-target
* Do not lose PS_MAXFETCH (13) exit status when hitting maxpoll. Reported by
  Michelle Konzack, Debian Bug#508667.
* Do not overlap source and destination fields in snprintf() in interface.c.
  Courtesy of Nico Golde, Debian.
* When a pre- or post-connect command fails, now report the exit status or
  termination signal properly through sys/wait.h macros.
* When acquiring a body, understand NIL ("no such data item"), as returned by
  some MS Exchange versions. Fixes BerliOS Bug #11980 by KB Sriram.
* Make progress tickers (-v/--showdots) consistent, and update documentation 
  accordingly ("." for each 1024 octets read, "#" for a header written, and "*" 
  for each body line written.)
  The conditions under which these had been printed were inconsistent,
  illogical, and documentation hadn't matched real behaviour for long.
* For NTLM authentication, use dynamically allocated buffers.
  Fixes Debian Bug#449179, reported by Stepan Golosunov.
* Non-delivery notice ("bounce mail") now mentions the original reason again,
  before the address list. This fixes a regression introduced in 6.3.0.
* Several compiler warnings were fixed.
* The minimum recommended SMTP (RFC-5321) timeouts are enforced to leave
  sufficient time for the listener to respond. Some synchronous listeners,
  particularly when used with spam filtering and other policy enforcement
  services, take extended amounts of time to process messages after the sender,
  recipient, or data block and EOM line. This can cause fetchmail to not wait
  long enough for the "250 Ok" and make fetchmail believe the message wasn't
  properly delivered when in fact it was; fetchmail would then retry the
  download next time and never make progress.
  Fixes Berlios Bug #10972, reported by Viktor Binzberger.
* The ESMTP/LMTP client will now apply an application-specific timeout while
  waiting for the EHLO/LHLO response, rather than wait for the server or TCP
  connection timeout.
* Treat 530 errors as temporary, so as not to delete messages on configuration
  errors. Partially taken from Petr Cerny's patch in Novell Bugzilla #246829.
  The 501 part of said patch was not added, as the maintainer is not convinced
  501 is a temporary condition, and softbounce takes care of this anyways.

# CHANGES
* Make the comparison of the SSL fingerprints case insensitive, to
  ease its use. Suggested by Daniel Richard G.
* Proper precedence ordering for the syslog and logfile options. If the logfile
  option is effective (i. e. we're in daemon mode and nodetach isn't used),
  reset the syslog option. If logfile is ineffective (we're not in daemon mode,
  or nodetach is set), syslog takes precedence.
* The sleeping at/awakened at messages appear in logfiles and syslog only if
  verbose mode is enabled.  On the console, they will still appear without
  verbose mode.  Fixes Debian Bug#282259.
* fetchmail only requests IPv6 addresses via name service if at least one is
  configured on the local host, likewise for IPv4.  (AI_ADDRCONFIG flag to
  getaddrinfo()) Extended version of Redhat's patch.
* If the server name contains "yahoo.com", offers the "ID" capability, and we're
  polling via IMAP, send an ID ("guid" "1") transaction first, ignoring its
  result. This appears needed to be able to log into Yahoo's Zimbra servers, but
  there are open issues (such as being only able to download one message and
  server certificate mismatches).

# CHANGES TO CONTRIB
* Fix bashism in contrib/fetchsetup. Fixes Debian Bug#530081.

# DOCUMENTATION
* Some parts of the the manual page were revised for clarity, accuracy, and
  updated recommendations (particularly SSL/TLS) and formatting conventions from
  man-pages(7).
* The README and README.SSL documents were updated.
* A document, README.SSL-SERVER, was added to describe server-side requirements
  for proper SSL and/or TLS service offerings. These are not specific to
  fetchmail.
* Documentation on how to make "NOMAIL" (exit code 1) not treated an error has
  been added to the EXIT CODES section of the manpage and to the FAQ as item C8.
  The suggested solution uses a tiny POSIX shell script fragment.
  Fixes Debian Bug #530749, filed by Reuben Thomas.

fetchmail 6.3.9 (released 2008-11-16):

# SECURITY AND CRITICAL BUG FIXES:
* CVE-2007-4565: Denial of service: When fetchmail tries to inject a warning
  message it created itself, and the message is refused by the SMTP listener,
  fetchmail dereferences a NULL pointer and crashes. Report & fix by Earl Chew.
  Note while this is theoretically a remote denial of service attack vector,
  fetchmail by default talks SMTP to the localhost, so the overall risk is
  rather low.
  This bug was apparently introduced on 1998-11-27 when the bouncemail facility
  was modularized. The bug then made its appearance in fetchmail release 4.6.8.
  See also fetchmail-SA-2007-02.txt.
* CVE-2008-2711: Denial of service: When fetchmail logs data blobs
  (for instance, a To: header in -v -v verbose mode) in excess of 2048
  bytes, it will crash, because it hands an uninitialized argument
  pointer (not the format string though) to vsnprintf and reads a
  random memory location (it calls va_arg() too often without
  resetting it with va_start()). Based on a patch (BerliOS patch #2492)
  by Petr Uzel, fixes Novell Bug #354291.
  Note 6.3.9-rc1 did not completely fix this issue, so it was redrawn a few 
  hours after its release.
  See also fetchmail-SA-2008-01.txt.
* When expunging, mark the right messages as seen to avoid message loss in "keep
  flush" configurations.  Workaround for previous versions: "expunge 0".
  Report and patch by Alexander Cherepanov - thanks a lot, Berlios Bug #11797,
  "imap_mark_seen doesn't consider expunged messages".
* SSL fix: close memory leak when SSL connection fails; fetchmail used to forget
  calling SSL_free() on the SSL context, leaking in excess of 500 kB RAM on a
  x86_64 system per failed SSL connection attempt.
  Bug reported and patch provided by Seiichi Ikarashi, Fujitsu.

# BUG FIXES:
* The configure script will additionally check for 'dn_skipname', to fix build
  failures with µClibc. The new check still recognizes the resolver libraries on
  Ubuntu 7.04, openSUSE 10.2, Solaris 8, NetBSD 4.0_BETA2 and FreeBSD 6.2.
  Fixes Gentoo bug #134187.
  NOTE: this is a bit of a hack, since we twist the HAVE_RES_SEARCH result, but
  res_search() and dn_skipname() are only used together and scheduled for
  removal in future versions, so this is probably fine.
* No longer complain about invalid sslproto "" when POP3 CAPA probe fails.
  Fixes Debian Bug#421446 (Holger Leskien), Novell Bug #247233 (Jon Nelson),
  Red Hat Bug#503881.
  Thanks to Matthias Strauß for a configuration to reproduce the issue.
* Allow .fetchmailrc and .fetchids to be symlinks, as the manpage does not
  document they aren't allowed - fixes Debian Bug #452907 (Roger Leigh).
  TOCTOU race persists.
* fetchmailconf quotes mailbox (folder) names when writing the configuration.
  Fixes BerliOS Bug #13207 (reported + fix suggested by Terry Brown).
* Only print "Deleting fetchids file" if there actually is one.
  Fixes Debian Bug#374514, reported by Dan Jacobson.
* SSL fix: check and report if SSL_set_fd fails.

# CHANGES:
* autoconf 2.60 is now required to build fetchmail; it uses
  AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS to replace AC_AIX, AC_MINIX, and the like.
* Removed dead FETCHMAIL_DEBUG code from fetchmail.h that was disabled by 
  default with no switches in configure to enable it. However, the macro would 
  have been prone to a symlink attack. Found by Nico Golde.
* Removed dead FORCE_STUFFING code from socket.c that was disabled by default
  with no switches in configure to enable it.
* Include the typedef for int16 in the #ifndef _AIX in smbencrypt.c (Peter
  O'Gorman)
* Correct check for u_int32_t in configure.ac (seems to be typedef'ed in
  namser.h on some platforms.) (Peter O'Gorman)
* In configure.ac change all CPFLAGS to CPPFLAGS, CEFLAGS to CFLAGS and LDEFLAGS
  to LDFLAGS otherwise the results of some tests (additional -L and -I flags) do
  not get used for later tests causing incorrect configure results. Makefile.am
  was also changed to reflect this. (Peter O'Gorman)
* m4/gethostbyname_r.m4 does AC_TRY_COMPILE, which unfortunately can pass even
  if there is no gethostbyname_r. Changed to AC_TRY_LINK. (Peter O'Gorman)
* Revise getnameinfo check to ensure NULL is defined and the result is properly
  evaluated, to avoid bogus results on for instance FreeBSD and redefinitions of
  NI_* at compile time. (Matthias Andree).
* __attribute__ ((unused)) is a gccism, removed from libesmtp/gethostbyname.c.
  (Peter O'Gorman)
* In KAME/getnameinfo.c it's best to use the correct argument to inet_ntoa.
  (Peter O'Gorman)
* In verbose mode, log if --check mode is enabled.
* Add sslcommonname option (rcfile and commandline) as a way to work around
  misconfigured upstream SSL servers that use the wrong certificate name. It
  specifies which CommonName fetchmail expects and logs. (Daniel Richard G.)
* Changed CRLF to LF line endings in contrib/delete-later (reporter: Petr Uzel)
* SSL change: enable all workarounds with SSL_CTX_set_options(ctx,SSL_OP_ALL)
* All translations have been re-enabled, in an attempt to rekindle translator or
  user interest.

# DOCUMENTATION:
* Add fetchmail-SA-2007-02.txt and fetchmail-SA-2008-01.txt.
* Re-add two lines to the manual page that had accidentally become comments 
  to nroff. One was part of the --sslproto documentation, and one in the 
  "Awakening the background daemon" section.
* The manual page no longer asserts that .fetchids were for exclusive POP3 use, 
  since it is planned to use the file with IMAP4 later.
* Add grammar fixes from Dan Jacobson to fetchmail.man. Debian Bug #461642.
* The manual page now mentions that user descriptions need to come before user
  options. Reported by Francensco Pontortì, to fix Debian Bug #467010.
* The manual page no longer hints that multi-user declarations per server were
  only useful in daemon mode running as root, to avoid hinting people to doing
  that.
* Several manual page rcfile examples now include "ssl".
* The manual page hints that option arguments beginning with numbers can be
  enclosed in quotes.
* The manual page now mentions that the --logfile must already exist before
  fetchmail is run.
* The FAQ now recommends (#I9) not to use Google Mail for their disregard to the
  protocols they claim to support.
* Documentation and program output now /consistently/ claim that the rcfile must
  not have more than 0700 (u=rwx,g=,o=) permissions, but fetchmail will still
  silently accept additional g=x permissions for compatibility with previous
  6.2.X and 6.3.X versions.
  Inconsistency (program 0710, manpage 0600) reported by Petr Uzel.
* The --logfile documentation is now clearer about requiring detached daemon 
  mode.

fetchmail 6.3.8 (released 2007-04-06):

# SECURITY STRENGTHENING:
* Make the APOP challenge parser more distrustful and have it reject challenges
  that do not conform to RFC-822 msg-id format, in the hope to make mounting
  man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM) against APOP a bit more difficult.
  (CVE-2007-1558, reported by Gaëtan Leurent, published 2007-04-02 on Bugtraq)

  APOP is claimed insecure by Gaëtan Leurent for MITM scenarios for typical
  setups: based on MD5 collisions, it is purportedly possible to recover the
  first three characters of the shared secret (password), which would then make
  recovery of the shared secret a matter of hours or minutes; this would then
  enable the attacker to impersonate the client vis-à-vis the server.

  For further details, check

  to APOP", Fast Software Encryption 2007, Luxembourg. (Proceedings to appear in

* Fix manual page: --sslcheck -> --sslcertck, and do not set trailing 
  "recommended:" in bold. Fixes Debian Bug #413059, reported by Rafal Czlonka.
* Repoll immediately if a protocol error happens during the authentication 
  attempt after a failed opportunistic TLS upgrade.
  Fixes comment #9 in Gentoo Bug #163782, reported by Takuto Matsuu.
* Fix rendering of the "24 - 26, 28, 29" paragraph in the exit codes section. 
  Reported by Nico Golde.
* If SOCKS support was compiled in, add 'socks' to the feature_options Python
  list emitted in --configdump. Reported by Rob MacGregor.
* Do not crash with a null pointer dereference when opening the BSMTP file 
  fails. Improve error checking and reporting. Reported by Reto Schüttel,
  Debian Bug#416625. Fix based on a patch by Nico Golde.
* Make BSMTP output actually work, it would persistently fail with SOCKET error
  after writing the first header. Bug independently found and reported in
  excellent detail by Reto Schüttel, Debian Bug#416812.

# DOCUMENTATION:
* Add fetchmail-SA-2007-01.txt
* Extend --mda documentation, discourage use of qmail-inject.

  Thanks to Jochen Hayek, Michael Shuldman and Rob MacGregor.
* Use envelope option in multidrop example. Patch by Rob MacGregor.
* Document expected Received: line format when parsing for envelope addressees.
* Stripped option documentation from sample.rcfile, since this is bound to go
  out of synch with the manual page, which is the only reference on options.
* Mention that --limit default is 0 bytes, which is special for "no limit".
* Corrected Robert M. Funk's name that I misspelled. My sincere apologies

fetchmail 6.3.6 (released 2007-01-04):

# SECURITY FIXES:
* CVE-2006-5867, fetchmail-SA-2006-02.txt:
  Password disclosure vulnerability fixed. This has several aspects:

  - Fetchmail now implies sslproto 'tls1' if the sslfingerprint or sslcertck
    options are used and the ssl option is not used, in order to be sure that
    fetchmail gets a certificate from the mail server.

  - Fetchmail breaks the connection if the TLS negotiation (or verification, if
    requested) fails with sslproto 'tls1', sslfingerprint or sslcheck enabled.

  - POP3 connections now use STLS reliably. They used to ignore STLS altogether
    for serveral values of the "auth" option, when fetchmail forget to probe
    server capabilities - see fetchmail-SA-2006-02.txt for details.

  - POP3 connections will no longer fall back USER/PASS authentication if
    strong challenge-response authenticators such as CRAM-MD5 are configured
    but the server does not advertise these in its CAPA response.

  - POP2 is obsolete and does not support STLS or anything beyond password-based
    authentication. The attempt to use STLS or strong authenticators now causes
    connection abort.

  Configurations using both ssl and sslcertck however have been semi-safe in
  that they would send the password in the clear. The USER/PASS fallback
  problem however applies to these too, so that the password was only safe on
  trustworthy servers.

* CVE-2006-5974, fetchmail-SA-2006-03.txt:
  Repairs a regression in 6.3.5 that crashes fetchmail when a message with
  invalid headers is found while fetchmail's mda option is in use. BerliOS bugs
  #9364, #9412, #9449. Stack backtrace provided by Neil Hoggarth - thanks.

# REGRESSION FIXES (recently introduced bugs)
* Repair --logfile, broken in 6.3.5. BerliOS Bug #9059,
  reported by Brian Harring.
* Repair --user, broken in 6.3.5 (as a side effect of the authenticate external
  patch): using SSL certificate/key authentication overrode the --user option.
  Now the latter takes precedence, and only defaults to the certificate's common
  name.  Debian Bug #400950, reported by Jorgen Schaefer <forcer@debian.org>.

# BUG FIXES (long-standing bugs):
* RPOP: used to log the password locally rather than an asterisk as the other
  protocols do. The password is now shrouded in the local logs.
* POP3: Probes capabilities now when Kerberos V5 is enabled, so that we can
  actually detect if the server supports it.
* Robustness: If a stale lockfile cannot be deleted, truncate it so that
  fetchmail doesn't later believe itself to be running if the PID is recycled
  by a non-fetchmail process.
* DNS: Detect /etc/resolv.conf changes: On systems that have res_search(),
  assume we also have res_init() and call it (suggested by Ulrich Drepper,
  glibc bug #3675) in order to make libc or libresolv reread the resolver
  configuration at the beginning of a poll cycle.  This is important when
  fetchmail is in daemon mode and /etc/resolv.conf is changed later by dhcpcd,
  dhclient, pppd, openvpn or other ip-up/ipchange scripts.  Should fix Debian
  Bug#389270, Bug#391698.
* Robustness: Fix crash on systems that do not provide strdup(), the crash
  happens only in out-of-memory conditions when fetchmail cannot proceed
  anyways.  Patch by Andreas Krennmair.
* Robustness: When HOME and FETCHMAILHOME are unset, be sure to copy user
  database information, so it is not trashed later. Patch by Jim Correia.

# CHANGES:
* Workaround: Improve handling of IMAP IDLE, some servers do not reset their
  time counters after sending information asynchronously. Patch by Sunil
  Shetye, after report from Andrew Baumann.
* Usability: When requesting Kerberos or GSSAPI, complain and exit with syntax
  error if any of these requested features has not been compiled in.  This is
  to fail early and with precise error message. Reported by Isaac Wilcox.
* --version will now add +KRB4 or +KRB5 if Kerberos v4 or v5, respectively, have
  been compiled in. Reported missing by Isaac Wilcox.

# TRANSLATIONS:
* New en_GB (British English) translation by David Lodge.
* Update Japanese (Takeshi Hamasaki), Polish (Jakub Bogusz), Russian (Pavel
  Maryanov) and Vietnamese (Clytie Siddall) translations.
! Note that not all these translations are complete -- this isn't the
  translators' fault though, but due to delays at the BerliOS hosting site and
  the translation project handlers. You may see a few untranslated messages.

# DOCUMENTATION:
* Dropped exit status 15 from manual page, it's not used by fetchmail.
  Reported by Isaac Wilcox.
* Documented exit codes 24 - 29 as internal.

fetchmail 6.3.5 (released 2006-10-09):

# BUG FIXES:
* For protocols such as IMAP that are not delimited by "." lines, truncate the
  input buffer when the message has been completely read, to avoid taking
  trailing garbage into the message if the terminal CRLF is missing. Fixes
  Debian Bug#312415. (Patch suggested by Mike Jones, Manchester Univ.).
* When using NTLM authentication, use regular IMAP response code handler after
  completing NTLM handshake, for robustness and consistency.
  (Taken from the NetBSD portable packages collection, patch-ac.)
* Support Kerberos installations where krb5.h and perhaps roken.h are in
  .../include/krb5.  Taken from NetBSD portable packages collection patch-ae.
* On NetBSD, link against -lroken -lcom_err if --with-kerberos is enabled.
* Drop #include <com_err.h> from Kerberos 5 header file, fixes compile error on
  SUSE Linux 10.0.
* Fix des_pcbc_encrypt compile warnings in kerberos.c line 246.
* If krb5-config provides gssapi library information, use that rather than
  guessing.
* Improve --with-gssapi auto detection for /usr-based GSSAPI installs.
* Fix --with-gssapi builds for NetBSD 3.0.
* Improve KAME/getnameinfo.c portability to Linux libc5 systems.
  Based on a patch by Dan Fandrich.
* Provide INET6 to KAME/getnameinfo.c (only useful on IPv6-enabled systems that
  lack getnameinfo, and there only visible in some Received: headers).
  Found by Dan Fandrich.
* POP3: some UID flags may not be set properly on UIDL lists. (Sunil Shetye)
* Make IMAP4 IDLE work on servers that do not update RECENT counts.
  Reported by Lars Tewes.
* IMAP4 patch by Sunil Shetye:
  - do not depend on server updating RECENT counts at all
  - also enter IDLE loop when messages are present on the server.
* Fix --flush description in the manual page, fetchmail does not mark messages
  seen unless it has successfully delivered them. Suggested by Frederic Marchal.
* Fetchmail no longer attempts to stat the "-" file in daemon mode -- this is a
  special name to read the RC file from stdin, and cannot always be re-read
  anyways. BerliOS bug #7858.
* When looking up ports for a service, the lookup succeeds and the returned
  address family isn't IPv4 or IPv6, properly free the allocated memory from the
  service lookup. Found by Uli Zappe.
* When looking up ports for a service, only look up TCP ports.
* Avoid compiling empty files, to avoid diagnostics from strict compilers.
* If the lockfile ends before the process ID, treat it as stale and unlink it.
  Reported by Justin Pryzby, Debian Bug #376603.
* SIGHUP wake-up behavior was broken since 5.9.13's Cygwin changes, in that for
  non-root users, SIGHUP would abort the first poll and subsequently interfere
  with new polls, and SIGHUP would be ignored for root users. SIGHUP now matches
  documented behavior. SIGUSR1 has always been a wakeup signal for both root
  (undocumented) and non-root users. See also the deprecation warning above.
* Track getaddrinfo() results to properly free them after timeouts and make sure
  that getaddrinfo() isn't interrupted by a timeout (which breaks on MacOS X),
  reported by Uli Zappe.  This should fix Debian Bug#294547 and Bug#377135.
* --logfile is now handled more carefully, errors opening the logfile are
  now reported to the TTY where fetchmail was started from.
* fetchmail now complains and aborts when it cannot properly daemonize itself.
* fix compilation on systems that don't know struct addrinfo (Solaris 2.6).
* ignore SIGPIPE signals and rely on functions to return EPIPE instead. This is
  necessary because the former longjmp() from the signal handler is unsafe and
  makes the whole fetchmail behavior undefined after the event.
* Avoid crash in env.c/host_fqdn if we cannot canonicalize our own hostname.
  Reported by Alexander Holler.
* SSL fix by Miloslav Trmac (Red Hat): free the SSL contexts after the
  connection, to avoid from growing SSL certpaths without bounds, avoid using
  SSL contexts for unrelated connections, and to fix Red Hat Bug #206346.

# CHANGES:
* Rename all fetchmail-internal lock_* functions to fm_lock_*. Obsoletes
  NetBSD portable packages collection patch-ah, patch-ai and patch-aj.
* Configure prints a warning (but proceeds) if Kerberos IV support is enabled.
* In verbose mode, log every IP fetchmail tries to connect to, to avoid
  misleading the user. Suppress EAFNOSUPPORT errors from socket() call, too.
  Fixes Debian Bug #361825, reported by Daniel Baur.
* In idle mode, fetchmail complains about the fetchall option.
* When a connection fails, log not only the IP address, but also host and
  service name and the port number. Log the latter when trying to connect in
  verbose mode, too.
* Keep syslog output at one line per message (this works if no errors occur).
* Fetchmail in verbose mode now logs if it opportunistically upgrades a POP3
  or IMAP connection to TLS security with STLS/STARTTLS.
* fetchmail now supports foo@example.org=bar user mappings for multidrop boxes.
* switch setjmp/longjmp to sigsetjmp/siglongjmp
* IMAP now supports the EXTERNAL authentication method, courtesy of
  Götz 'nimrill' Babin-Ebell, BerliOS patch #1095 with minor changes.
  Note that this change causes --sslcert to override --user.
* The sslproto keywords are now case insensitive, courtesy of
  Götz 'nimrill' Babin-Ebell, BerliOS patch #1095.
* When going to sleep, log for how long.  Suggested by Claudia Ludwig.
* When the server name cannot be canonicalized, log the gai_strerror value.

# TRANSLATION UPDATES:
* Catalan/ca (Ernest Adrogué Calveras), Japanese/ja (Takeshi Hamasaki) - also
  made gettext 0.15 ready, Polish/pl (Jakub Bogusz), Russian/ru (Pavel
  Maryanov), Spanish/es (Héctor García Álvarez), Vietnamese/vi (Clytie Siddall)

# CONTRIBUTED SCRIPTS:
* PopDel.py was revised by Joshua Crawford to display the From: address and
  list every email, even if it has no Subject: header; and not delete the wrong
  message in the presence of mail without Subject: headers.

fetchmail 6.3.4 (released 2006-04-14):

# BUG FIXES:
* configure: detect res_* functions properly with newer glibc ABIs.
  Patch by Miloslav Trmac.
* tracepolls: add folder information if available. Reported by Terry Brown.
* lexer: add %option noyywrap to avoid link errors about missing yywrap().
* a few more type fixes for report/snprintf, patch by Miloslav Trmac.
* bouncing: fetchmail would still send "General SMTP/ESMTP error." bounces
  in spite of "no bouncemail" configuration.
* SSL/TLS: if, for a certain server, an sslfingerprint is specified and
  sslcertck is NOT set, suppress printing SSL certificate mismatch errors.
  (Reported by Hannes Erven.)
* SSL/TLS: always print if the sslfingerprint mismatches, even in silent
  mode.  (This is for consistency with certificate verification errors.)

# TRANSLATION UPDATES:
* German/de (Matthias Andree), French/fr (Matthias Andree), Spanish/es (Héctor
  García), Polish/pl (Jakub Bogusz), Japanese/ja (Takeshi Hamasaki)
* New Vietnamese/vi translation (Clytie Siddall).
* Updated French descriptions for the .spec file (Stéphane Schildknecht,
  Luc Pionchon, Matthias Andree).

# CHANGES:
* pidfile: there is a new command-line (--pidfile PATH) and global option for
  the rcfile (set pidfile [=] "/path/to/pidfile") option to allow overriding
  the default location of the PID file.
  Requested by Héctor García, Debian maintainer.
* specgen.sh: Converted to UTF-8 to support translated texts better.

fetchmail 6.3.3 (released 2006-03-30):

# BUG FIXES:
* SEGFAULT: Do not attempt to overwrite the netrc password if none has been
  specified.  This fixes a segmentation fault bug introduced into 6.3.2.
  Fixes BerliOS bug #6234.  BerliOS patch #804 by Craig Leres.
  The patch, as accepted into fetchmail, was available separately from
  <http://download.berlios.de/fetchmail/patch-6.3.2.1-fix-netrc-SIGSEGV.diff>
* SEGFAULT: Work around C libraries that return a NULL in getaddrinfo()'s
  ai_canonname record, to avoid a segfault. Affects for instance FreeBSD 4.10,
  4.11 and 5.3 when dotted quads are given as server names.
  Analysis and fix by Vladimir Olegovich Ravodin (Владимир Олегович Раводин).
* IMAP: fix hangs in NOOP-based IDLE emulation. Reported by Casper Gripenberg
  and Brendan Lynch, fix by Sunil Shetye (his patch was merged) and Brendan Lynch.
* IMAP: Handle other clients concurrently accessing IMAP mailboxes better.
  Fetchmail quits the poll if the EXPUNGE count does not match expectations, and
  servers not updating RECENT counts after EXPUNGE are handled in a better way.
  (Patch by Sunil Shetye.)
* IMAP: Stop sending EXPUNGE after NOOP-idling (patch by Sunil Shetye).
* POP3: fetchmail can now use UIDL in fetchall keep mode, to avoid re-fetching
  the same messages again when the fetchall keyword is removed. Patch by
  Sunil Shetye. For details, please see
  <http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/fetchmail-users/2006-March/000308.html>
* LMTP: fix bug in LMTP port validation (patch by Miloslav Trmac).
* SDPS: fetchmail no longer replaces the local user ID for an empty envelope
  sender when using the proprietary SDPS extension for POP3.
  Fixes Debian Bug#353575, reported by Roger Lynn.
* SDPS: Warn and disable SDPS if POP3 is disabled to avoid compilation errors.
* fetchmail no longer prints empty lines in verbose mode when using syslog.
* fetchmail no longer prints UID lists in verbose mode when using syslog.
* ./configure --quiet is now quieter (no SSL and fallback-related output).
* Miloslav Trmac's patch (with minor changes) to fix char * sign consistency,
  unused arguments and variables.
* More signedness, unused argument/variable and other warning fixes.

# CHANGES:
* --idle can now be specified on the command line, too.
* --fetchall is now supported on the command-line.
* POP3: Lower default fastuidl span to 4 (i. e. every 4th run fetches the
  whole UIDL list), patch by Sunil Shetye.

# DOCUMENTATION:
* "ssl" is a user option rather than a server option. Patch by Nico Golde.
  Fixes Debian Bug#354661, reported by Keith Hellman.
* The manual page now suggests "--" before the addresses in the sendmail MDA
  example, for safety.
* The FAQ item X9, Domino IMAP omits Content-Transfer-Encoding header, was
  added. Information provided by Anthony Kim on the fetchmail-friends list
  in March 2006.
* Credit Chris Boyle with the NOOP emulation code for IDLE in fetchmail 6.2.4.
  Eric forgot to credit Chris, thanks to Sunil Shetye for providing these links:
  http://lists.ccil.org/pipermail/fetchmail-friends/2003-July/007705.html
  http://lists.ccil.org/pipermail/fetchmail-friends/2003-July/007713.html
* Added a section about RETR vs. TOP to the manual page.
* Changed section/subsection levels in some areas.

fetchmail 6.3.2 (released 2006-01-22):

Unless otherwise noted, changes to this release were made by Matthias Andree.

# SECURITY FIX IN THIS RELEASE
* CVE-2006-0321: Fix segfault or bus error after bouncing a message.  This bug
  was introduced into 6.3.0 when removing alloca(); it caused fetchmail to free
  random memory.  Reported by Nathaniel W. Turner, Debian Bug#348747.
  See fetchmail-SA-2006-01.txt

# INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:
* Automatically disable the POP3 TOP command if the greeting string contains
  "Maillennium POP3/PROXY server", which is used by comcast and known to
  truncate messages after 80 kByte. Fall back to RETR, and complain if we had
  used TOP otherwise (the warning is printed only once per server in daemon
  mode).  Suggested by Ed Wilts.
  *Note* that this means messages are marked read on these servers, which is a
  deviation from how 6.3.1 behaved, but we have no alternative, comcast haven't
  fixed this bug in years.  Preventing the loss of the remainder of the message
  justifies this incompatible fix.
* fetchmail, since 6.3.0, requires write permission to the directory holding the
  idfile. See the amendment in the 6.3.0 MAJOR INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES section
  below for details. The manual page was updated.

# CHANGES RELEVANT TO PACKAGERS:
* The outdated BUGS document was removed from the distribution.
* Added fetchmail-SA-2006-01.txt to the distribution.

# BUG FIXES:
* SMTP/LMTP cleanup to fix these two bugs:
  - switch back to SMTP after having tried LMTP hosts (multiple smtphost hosts)
  - switch back to LMTP after sending a bounce.
  The patch removes the global state variable that was the root of this problem.
  Patch by Sunil Shetye. (MA)
* Don't complain about fetchall keep in --configdump mode. Bug introduced in
  6.3.0.
* fetchmailconf.py: Fix novice help for Poll interval and fetchall.
  Reported by Justin Pryzby, Debian Bug #344978.
* Some verbose output disappeared in debug mode. Adding further -v options would
  alternate between verbose and debug mode. debug mode now comprises all verbose
  output, and adding more -v options does not switch back from debug to verbose
  mode.
* fetchmail.man: Fix accented characters in Héctor García's name. Merged from
  downstream debian/patches/01_man_page.dpatch.
* Add missing --help text for "--sslcertck" option.
* fetchmailconf.py: Accept --help and --version.
* fetchmail --version  now prints the copyright notice.
* don't complain about READ-ONLY IMAP folders in --fetchall --keep mode.
  Reported Alexander Zangerl, Debian Bug#348964.
* the RPM .spec file now generates a -debuginfo package on newer RPM versions.

fetchmail 6.3.1 (released 2005-12-19):

# SECURITY FIX IN THIS RELEASE
* CVE-2005-4348 Fix segmentation fault (null pointer dereference) in
  multidrop mode with headerless email.  See fetchmail-SA-2005-03.txt.
  Reported by Daniel Drake, patch by Sunil Shetye. (MA)

# OTHER BUG FIXES, DOCUMENTATION AND TRANSLATION UPDATES
* Fix broken default port in POP2. Patch by Stanislav Brabec, SUSE [CZ]. (MA)
* Fix manual page, some lines starting with ' were escaped by \&.
  Reported by Simon Barner. (MA)
* Ship with gettext-0.14.3 again, as 6.2.9-rc10 did. Found by Sunil Shetye. (MA)
* Actually set default SSL certificate path if --sslcertpath is unset.
  Reported by Heino Tiedemann and Rob MacGregor. (MA)
* Remove bogus Netscape IMAP4rev1 Service >= 3.6 warning about BODY[TEXT]
  that we are not using. Patch by Sunil Shetye. (MA)
* Plug potential memory and socket leak when polling multiple folders or when
  the upstream sends bogus message sizes.  Patch by Sunil Shetye. (MA)
* Update Catalan translation, by Ernest Adrogué Calveras. (MA)
* Fix segfault (null pointer dereference) on some operating systems with
  fetchmail's obsolete DNS MX/host alias lookups in multidrop mode.
  Patch by Dr.-Ing. Andreas Haakh. (MA)
* Close SMTP sockets early, to reduce resource usage, trigger earlier delivery
  with some MTAs and avoid SIGPIPE (SIG 13) when the SMTP listener gets bored
  and drops the connection after timeout.  Patch by Sunil Shetye. (MA)
* Don't treat hitting a fetch limit as error.  Patch by Sunil Shetye. (MA)
* Fix negative "messages left on server" on idle/repoll with fetchlimit.
  Patch by Sunil Shetye. (MA)
* Properly track logout stage.  Patch by Sunil Shetye. (MA)
* Preserve error conditions across postconnect script.  Sunil Shetye. (MA)
* Do not trash destination domain if multiple messages are forwarded into the
  same SMTP/LMTP connection. Reported by Joachim Feise, Berlios Bug #5849. (MA)
* Manual page: Add "-md5" to "openssl x509" example in --sslfingerprint
  documentation, since OpenSSL 0.9.8 changed the default to SHA1.
  Suggested by Jason White. (MA)
* Cope with servers that return UID information in response to non-UID
  RFC822.{SIZE|HEADER} requests. Reported by Jason White.
  Patch suggestion by by Sunil Shetye, simplified by MA.

fetchmail 6.3.0 (released 2005-11-30):

# SECURITY FIXES IN THIS RELEASE
* CVE-2005-2335: The POP3 UIDL code doesn't sufficiently validate/truncate the
  input length, so a (malicious or compromised) server that sends UIDs longer
  than 128 bytes can corrupt fetchmail's stack and crash fetchmail.
  This vulnerability is remotely exploitable to inject code run in a
  root shell. Edward J. Shornock, Ludwig Nussel. fetchmail-SA-2005-01.txt
* CVE-2005-3088: fetchmailconf now changes the output file to mode 0600 BEFORE
  writing to it, so there is no window where passwords could be read by the
  world. Matthias Andree. fetchmail-SA-2005-02.txt

# MAJOR INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
* Remove support for --netsec/-T options, the required inet6_apps library is no
  longer available.
  http://www.inner.net/pub/ipv6/ states, as of 2005-07-03: "/pub/ipv6
  Our IPv6 software is now long defunct. Please find a more modern source."
  I haven't been able to find a more modern source.  Matthias Andree
* Operating systems that do not conform to the Single Unix Specification v2
  (1997) or v3 (2001, aka IEEE Std 1003.1-2001) are no longer supported. They
  may continue to work and non-intrusive patches to support them may be
  accepted.  Matthias Andree
* The default for --smtphost is now always "localhost" regardless of
  authentication types and protocols, so as to simplify configurations for
  workstations where the SMTP daemon only listens on the loopback interface.
  Sunil Shetye & Matthias Andree
Amendment, 2006-01-04:
* fetchmail's idfile (.fetchids) is no longer written directly, but the ids are
  written to a temporary file which is renamed into place after being written
  completely. This is to avoid writing incomplete idfiles when running out of
  space, which would cause excessive duplicate refetches of messages, this might
  make matters even worse. This means that fetchmail requires write permission
  on the directory holding the idfile. This will usually affect system-global
  daemons only, for instance, Debian. Found by Dan Jacobson. Matthias Andree.
Escalated to "incompatible", 2006-01-13:
* Try to obtain FQDN as our own host by default, rather than using "localhost".
  If hostname cannot be qualified, complain noisily and continue, unless
  Kerberos, ODMR or ETRN are used (these have always required an FQDN).
  Partial fix of Debian Bug#150137. Fixes Debian Bug#316454.  Matthias Andree

# CHANGES RELEVANT TO PACKAGERS AND USERS
* fetchmailconf is now a shell wrapper that calls the byte-compiled
  fetchmailconf.py script, which is now installed in the regular python
  directory. Matthias Andree.
* The --enable-inet6 configure option was removed. The code is mostly protocol
  agnostic, a fully IPv6 aware OS is expected to provide getaddrinfo(),
  getnameinfo() and the macro AF_INET6.  Matthias Andree.
* gettext (intl/) has been removed from the fetchmail package. Install GNU
  gettext 0.14 separately for NLS (i18n).  Matthias Andree
* Added Russian translation, courtesy of Pavel Maryanov of the
  Russian translation team. (MA)
* Updated and re-enabled Czech translation, by Miloslav Trmac (MA).
* Dropped da=Danish, el=Greek and tr=Turkish translations which have more than
  10% (61+) untranslated or fuzzy messages.  Matthias Andree.

  original version would go into an infinite loop when CAPA failed;
  found by David Greaves.) (MA)
* HOME_ETC patch for PLD Linux. (ESR)
* Sunil Shetye's fix for SSL configuration. (ESR)
* Simon Josefsson's patch for GSS library support. (ESR)

  mode after EXPUNGE when the server (Dovecot 0.99.10) doesn't update
  RECENT and EXISTS counts. (MA)
* Holger Mauermann's bounce patch, to use a NULL envelope from, not
  write a Return-Path header (both to meet RFC-2821), changed From,
  added Subject header, rewording the human readable part.  Fixes Debian
  bug #316446. (MA)
* Merge Sunil Shetye's time.h handling fix. (MA)
* Merge Gerd von Egidy's patch to avoid a segfault in multidrop/received
  mode when the Received: headers are malformatted. (MA)
* MIME-encode bodies and Subject headers of warning messages, limiting
  the header to 7 bits. (MA)
* Normalize most locale codesets to IANA codesets, based on
  norm_charmap.c by Markus Kuhn. (MA)
* Remove sleep(3) after POP3 login, patch by Brian Candler. (MA)
* Fix option parsing bug that trashes the showdots setting when more
  than one server is configured. Patch by Brian Candler. (MA)
* Honor sslcertpath setting even if sslcertck is unset. Patch by Brian
  Candler. (MA)
* SSL certificate checking fixes, don't display same error message twice
  in succession, make sure that Common Name and fingerprint checking are
  only done once. Print all validation warnings/errors even if not in
  verbose mode. Patch by Brian Candler. (MA)
* Import Bjorn Reese and Daniel Stenberg's MIT-licensed Trio 1.10 from
  http://daniel.haxx.se/projects/trio/ for systems that do not support
  snprintf or vsnprintf. (MA)
* Clean up the horrible #ifdef HAVE_[V]SNPRINTF that made the code
  unreadable. Use Trio where [v]snprintf is/are missing. (MA)
* Default to Linux 2.2 /proc/net/dev format, and use uname(2) to determine the
  kernel version instead of calling uname(1). Thanks to Paul Slootman.  (MA)
* Be more careful when swapping UID lists or writing the .fetchids file,
  requested by Manfred Weihs. (MA)
* Print a warning if multidrop configuration is attempted without
  envelope option. (MA)
* Split information on fetchmail versions before 6.0.0 to a separate
  OLDNEWS file. (MA)
* Merge SuSE patches: (sent by Stanislav Brabec, merged by Matthias Andree)
  - fetchmail-6.2.5-declaration.patch (double sigint_handler decl/getpass.c)
  - fetchmail-6.2.5-implicit-declaration.patch (missing #include)
  - fetchmail-6.2.5-random-result.patch (uninitialized variable/opie.c)
* Revised some bogus assertions about POP3 LAST and UIDL use in the
  manual page. UIDL isn't flaky as the man page suggested, but a
  reliability feature. In fact, IMAP4 code is flaky in that it relies on
  the upstream seen flags. (MA)
* Miloslav Trmac's patch for fetchmailconf to support string-type values
  of the "port" variable, avoiding "port None" corruption in .fetchmailrc.
  To fix Redhat Bug #55623 (MA)
* de.po fixes from Nico Golde (MA)
* es.po fixes from Jesus Roncero, Debian bug #286044 (MA)
* sink.c fix from Cesar Eduardo Barros, to avoid double @ in address
