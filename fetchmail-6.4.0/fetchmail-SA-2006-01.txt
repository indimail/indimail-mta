0. Release history
==================

2006-01-19	internal review draft
2006-01-20	add CVE ID
2006-01-22	release 1.0
2006-01-25	release 1.1, add fetchmail 6.3.2 to "Not affected" above.


1. Background
=============

fetchmail is a software package to retrieve mail from remote POP2, POP3,
IMAP, ETRN or ODMR servers and forward it to local SMTP, LMTP servers or
message delivery agents.

fetchmail ships with a graphical, Python/Tkinter based configuration
utility named "fetchmailconf" to help the user create configuration (run
control) files for fetchmail.


2. Problem description and Impact
=================================

Fetchmail contains a bug that causes itself to crash when bouncing a
message to the originator or to the local postmaster. The crash happens
after the bounce message has been sent, when fetchmail tries to free the
dynamic array of failed addresses, and calls the free() function with an
invalid pointer.  This bug was introduced short before fetchmail 6.3.0
and is not present in the now discontinued 6.2.X series (see below).


3. Workaround
=============

None known at this time.


4. Solution
===========

Download and install fetchmail 6.3.2 or a newer stable release from
fetchmail's project site at
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/files/>.


5. End of life announcement
===========================

The aged fetchmail 6.2.5.X branch is discontinued effective immediately.
No further releases from the 6.2.5.X branch will be made.

The new 6.3.X stable branch has been available since 2005-11-30
and will not change except for bugfixes, documentation and message
translations.
