.SH NAME
courierpop3d \- Courier POP3 server
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fB@sbindir@/couriertcpd\fR \fB-nodnslookup\fR \fB-stderr=syslog\fR \fB110\fR \fB@libexecdir@/courier/courierpop3login\fR [ \fB\fImodules\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ] \fB@libexecdir@/courier/courierpop3d\fR \fB\&./Maildir\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This is a simple POP3 server for Maildirs.
.sp
.RS
.B "Note:"
The \fBcouriertcpd\fR, \fBcourierpop3login\fR,
and \fBcourierpop3d\fR modules may be installed elsewhere than
indicated here.
.RE
.PP
\fBcourierpop3login\fR is usually started by
\fBcouriertcpd\fR\&. It
already expects that a POP3 client is connected to standard input and output,
presumably via a network socket.
\fBcourierpop3login\fR reads the POP3
userid and password, then runs the
authentication modules\&. The remaining
arguments are passed along as arguments to modules\&.
.PP
modules
is one or more authentication modules (see the
\fBauthlib\fR(7)
manual page).
.PP
Each authentication modules runs the program specified by its first
argument, allowing the authentication modules to be chained. The last program
in the chain is
\fBcourierpop3d\fR
, which provides the actual POP3 service. In
accordance with the authentication protocol, as described in
\fBauthlib\fR(7)
\fBcourierpop3d\fR reads
file descriptor 3 to see if the userid/password has been succesfully
validated. If not, \fBcourierpop3d\fR terminates.
.PP
Otherwise, \fBcourierpop3d\fR expects to be already running
under the
appropriate user and group id, with its current directory set to the account's
home directory.
.PP
The first order of business is to find the account's Maildir. If the
environment variable \fBMAILDIR\fR is set, that's where we go.
That should be the
pathname to the account's Maildir. The environment variable
\fBMAILDIR\fR may be set by the
authentication module.
If \fBMAILDIR\fR is not set,
\fBcourierpop3d\fR uses its first argument.
Usually, the default maildir is
\fI$HOME/Maildir\fR, therefore the first argument to
\fBcourierpop3d\fR is
"\&./Maildir".
