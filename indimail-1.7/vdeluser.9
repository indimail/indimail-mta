.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBvdeluser\fR removes a virtual domain email account from the system.
All files and directories for the user are removed from disk. All forwarding, aliases,
entries in database are also removed. The Directory Structure Layout's Hashed Component is
decremented by one. For a clustered domain, the user will be deleted only if the user lies on
the host where \fBvdeluser\fR is being run. \fBvdeluser\fR has the setuid bit set and must be
run as root or as indimail user. When run \fBvdeluser\fR changes its uid to the uid defined for the domain defined
in the assign file (See qmail-users(5)).

.SH POST HOOK
If the environment variable POST_HOOK is set, \fBvdeluser\fR executes the program defined by
the POST_HOOK environment variable, passing \fIemail_address\fR as a parameter. If POST_HOOK
is not defined, the program/script INDIMAIL/libexec/vdeluser will be executed with \fIemail_address\fR
as a parameter.
