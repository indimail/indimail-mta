<h3><a name="intro" id="intro">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>Courier-IMAP 4.0 brings many changes and improvements. All
authentication-related code in Courier-IMAP has been moved into the external
<a href="http://www.courier-mta.org/authlib/">Courier Authentication
Library</a>. See the contents of the <a href="INSTALL.html">INSTALL</a> file
for more information. Courier-IMAP now includes an IMAP/POP3 aggregation
proxy, like Perdition. See the "imap/README.proxy" file in the source
distribution for more information. Mail accounts can be distributed across a
pool of servers. A separate server (or another pool of servers) accept
connections from IMAP and POP3 clients, waits for the client's login request,
looks the mail account's server, and connects to the IMAP/POP3 server on the
right host, with the IMAP/POP3 client being no wiser. Any kind of an upper
limit on the scalability of the IMAP/POP3 server, or how large of a mail
store it can support, has been eliminated. The only limit to Courier-IMAP's
horizontal scaling is the available bandwidth on the LAN.</p>

<h3><a name="acl" id="acl">Shared folders and access control lists</a></h3>

<p>New to Courier-IMAP 3 are the ACL (access control list) IMAP extension,
and ACL-based virtual shared folders. Courier-IMAP 3 implements both the
existing ACL specification, RFC 2086, as well as an experimental
implementation of the second draft revision of the ACL specification. Virtual
shared folders is a different implementation of shared folders that
supplements an older implementation in Courier-IMAP 2, and earlier. The
older, POSIX permission-based shared folders are still implemented and
supported. Here's a summary of the differences between the two shared folder
mechanisms:</p>

<blockquote>

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>POSIX-based shared folders</th>
        <th>ACL shared folders<br />
        </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>May be used with system accounts only<sup>1</sup></td>
        <td>May be used with virtual accounts only; cannot be used on systems
          that have end-user login shell access: bypassing ACLs and accessing
          the folders directly is trivial<br />
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Access rights based on traditional POSIX filesystem
        permissions</td>
        <td>Access rights based on IMAP access control lists<br />
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Sharable folders must be set up manually, using the "maildirmake"
          command</td>
        <td>A site-specific process must be installed to compile an index of
          all virtual mailboxes; afterwords, individual users may create and
          manage shared folders themselves<br />
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <blockquote>
    <p><sup>1</sup> This is because access rights are governed by filesystem
    permissions. POSIX shared folders may also be used with virtual accounts,
    but it will not be possible to grant read-only access to shared folders,
    and everyone will be able to delete messages from shared folders (instead
    of only the creator of each message)</p>

<p>After installation, read the "maildiracl" manual page for a brief overview
of access control lists.</p>

<p>Read "maildir/README.sharedfolders.html" for information on configuring
