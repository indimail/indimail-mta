RELEASE NOTES
=============
DATE: @DATE@

This is Release @version@ of IndiMail. The release has both source.tar.gz and RPMs
This release adds a new program qmail-sql, which makes it easy to migrate qmail control
files to MySQL. IndiMail is probably the only MTA which gives you the flexibility of having
configuration in plain text, cdb or MySQL.

This release also adds a new control file 'badip' using which you can issue temporary SMTP
error code to clients having IP addresses listed in 'badip' or 'badip.cdb' or 'badip' table
in MySQL. This feature will help an ISP from the Republic of Macedonia to reject (for a day),
clients who spam, by executing the following command to be run once daily in cron.

# grep "X-Bogosity: Yes," /var/log/indimail/smtpd.25/current \
 | awk '{print $6}' > /var/indimail/control/badip
# /var/indmail/bin/qmail-cdb /var/indimail/control/badip

Two brand new checkpassword compatible authentication module sys-checkpwd and ldap-checkpwd
have been added in this release.

I am also pleased to introduce iwebadmin, a web frontend for IndiMail administration.
iwebadmin has been made possible by hacking qmailadmin - a popular web admin frontend for
qmail. I welcome others who are knowledgeable about web scripting, cgi scripts to further
enhance iwebadmin. iwebadmin will be part of iwebadmin sub folder.
