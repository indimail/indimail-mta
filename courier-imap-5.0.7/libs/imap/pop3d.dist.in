##NAME: MAXDAEMONS:0
#
#  Maximum number of POP3 servers started
#

MAXDAEMONS=40

##NAME: MAXPERIP:4
#
#  Maximum number of connections to accept from the same IP address

MAXPERIP=4

##NAME: POP3AUTH:1
#
# To advertise the SASL capability, per RFC 2449, uncomment the POP3AUTH
# variable:
#
# POP3AUTH="LOGIN"
#
# If you have configured the CRAM-MD5, CRAM-SHA1 or CRAM-SHA256, set POP3AUTH
# to something like this:
#
# POP3AUTH="LOGIN CRAM-MD5 CRAM-SHA1"

POP3AUTH=""

##NAME: POP3AUTH_ORIG:1
#
# For use by webadmin

POP3AUTH_ORIG="PLAIN LOGIN CRAM-MD5 CRAM-SHA1 CRAM-SHA256"

##NAME: POP3AUTH_TLS:1
#
# To also advertise SASL PLAIN if SSL is enabled, uncomment the
# POP3AUTH_TLS environment variable:
#
# POP3AUTH_TLS="LOGIN PLAIN"

POP3AUTH_TLS=""

##NAME: POP3AUTH_TLS_ORIG:0
#
# For use by webadmin

POP3AUTH_TLS_ORIG="LOGIN PLAIN"

##NAME: POP3_PROXY:0
#
# Enable proxying.  See README.proxy

POP3_PROXY=0

##NAME: PROXY_HOSTNAME:0
#
# Override value from gethostname() when checking if a proxy connection is
# required.

# PROXY_HOSTNAME=

##NAME: PORT:1
#
# Port to listen on for connections.  The default is port 110.
#
#  Multiple port numbers can be separated by commas.  When multiple port
#  numbers are used it is possibly to select a specific IP address for a
#  given port as "ip.port".  For example, "127.0.0.1.900,192.68.0.1.900"
#  accepts connections on port 900 on IP addresses 127.0.0.1 and 192.68.0.1
#  The ADDRESS setting is a default for ports that do not have a specified
#  IP address.

PORT=110

##NAME: ADDRESS:0
#
# IP address to listen on.  0 means all IP addresses.

ADDRESS=0

##NAME: AUTHSERVICE:0
#
#  It's possible to authenticate using a different 'service' parameter
#  depending on the connection's port.  This only works with authentication
#  modules that use the 'service' parameter, such as PAM.  Example:
#
#  AUTHSERVICE110=pop3
#  AUTHSERVICE995=pop3s

##NAME: TCPDOPTS:0
#
# Other couriertcpd(1) options.  The following defaults should be fine.
#

TCPDOPTS="-nodnslookup -noidentlookup"

##NAME: LOGGEROPTS:0
#
# courierlogger(1) options.
#

LOGGEROPTS="-name=pop3d"

##NAME: DEFDOMAIN:0
#
# Optional default domain. If the username does not contain the
# first character of DEFDOMAIN, then it is appended to the username.
# If DEFDOMAIN and DOMAINSEP are both set, then DEFDOMAIN is appended
# only if the username does not contain any character from DOMAINSEP.
# You can set different default domains based on the the interface IP
# address using the -access and -accesslocal options of couriertcpd(1).

#DEFDOMAIN="@example.com"

##NAME: POP3DSTART:0
#
# POP3DSTART is not referenced anywhere in the standard Courier programs
# or scripts.  Rather, this is a convenient flag to be read by your system
# startup script in /etc/rc.d, like this:
#
#  . @sysconfdir@/pop3d
#  case x$POP3DSTART in
#  x[yY]*)
#        @libexecdir@/pop3d.rc start
#        ;;
#  esac
#
# The default setting is going to be NO, until Courier is shipped by default
# with enough platforms so that people get annoyed with having to flip it to
# YES every time.

POP3DSTART=NO

##NAME: POP3_LOG_DELETIONS:0
#
#
# Set POP3_LOG_DELETIONS to log all message deletions to syslog.
#
# POP3_LOG_DELETIONS=1

##NAME: AUTH_MKHOMEDIR_SKEL:0
#
# Uncomment this setting to automatically create a home directory on first
# login. if the AUTH_MKHOMEDIR_SKEL environment variable is set, and the
# home directory does not exist, the home directory gets created, with its
# initial contents copied from AUTH_MKHOMEDIR_SKEL which must be a directory,
# typically /etc/skel.
#
# Note that this must be a complete home directory structure, including
# the maildir. Typically:
#
# mkdir /etc/skel
# chmod 700 /etc/skel
# maildirmak /etc/skel/Maildir
#
# This directory gets copied as is, preserving each file/subdirectory's
# permissions, with only userid/groupid changed to match the account's.
#
#
# AUTH_MKHOMEDIR_SKEL=/etc/skel

##NAME: MAILDIRPATH:0
#
# MAILDIRPATH - directory name of the maildir directory.
#
MAILDIRPATH=Maildir

##NAME: MIME_UNICODE_MESSAGE_TYPE:0
#
# MIME type that wraps Unicode messages for downloading by non-Unicode
# POP3 clients.
#
# This can be changed to "message/rfc822" to accomodate older mail clients.

MIME_UNICODE_MESSAGE_TYPE="message/global"
