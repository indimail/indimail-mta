1) Source Installation

Some of the sources that go into making IndiMail are comprised of two components. One is the
original source (e.g. qmail-1.03.tar.gz) and other is the patch (e.g. qmail-1.03.patch.gz).
You can always upgrade any component of Indimail if there is a new version of the original
software available and the author has made available a corresponding patch. That can
be done by repeating the specific steps for the updated component as mentioned in the
INSTALL document.

Some packages do not come with a patch. e.g. indimail, nssd. These can be upgraded by doing
the traditional ./configure <options>; make ; make install-strip


2) RPM Installation

For RPM, you just need to do

   % sudo rpm -Uvh <indimail_rpm_filename>

Lookout for specific UPGRADE information (if any) in the ChangeLog.
