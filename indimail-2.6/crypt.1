.SH DESCRIPTION
crypt is a command line impementation of crypt(3) password encryption function.
It is based on the Data Encryption Standard algorithm with variations
intended (among other things) to discourage use of hardware implementations of a key search.

\fIkey\fR is a user's typed password.

\fIsalt\fR is a two-character string chosen from the set [a-zA-Z0-9./]. This string is used to perturb the algorithm in one of
4096 different ways.

By taking the lowest 7 bits of each of the first eight characters of the key, a 56-bit key is obtained. This 56-bit key
is used to encrypt repeatedly a constant string (usually a string consisting of all zeros). The returned value points to
the encrypted password, a series of 13 printable ASCII characters (the first two characters represent the salt itself).
The return value points to static data whose content is overwritten by each call.

If
.I salt
is a character string starting with the characters "$\fIid\fP$"
followed by a string terminated by "$":
.RS

$\fIid\fP$\fIsalt\fP$\fIencrypted\fP

.RE
then instead of using the DES machine,
.I id
identifies the encryption method used and this then determines how the rest
of the password string is interpreted.
The following values of
.I id
are supported:
.RS
.TS
l l.
ID  | Method
_
1   | MD5
2a  | Blowfish (not in mainline glibc; added in some
    | Linux distributions)
.\" openSUSE has Blowfish, but AFAICS, this option is not supported
.\" natively by glibc -- mtk, Jul 08
.\"
.\" md5 | Sun MD5
.\" glibc doesn't appear to natively support Sun MD5; I don't know
.\" if any distros add the support.
5   | SHA-256 (since glibc 2.7)
6   | SHA-512 (since glibc 2.7)
.TE
.RE

So $5$\fIsalt\fP$\fIencrypted\fP is an SHA-256 encoded
password and $6$\fIsalt\fP$\fIencrypted\fP is an
SHA-512 encoded one.

"\fIsalt\fP" stands for the up to 16 characters
following "$\fIid\fP$" in the salt.
The encrypted part of the password string is the actual computed password.
The size of this string is fixed:
.TS
l l.
MD5     | 22 characters
SHA-256 | 43 characters
SHA-512 | 86 characters
.TE

The characters in "\fIsalt\fP" and "\fIencrypted\fP" are drawn from the set
[\fBa\-zA\-Z0\-9./\fP].
In the MD5 and SHA implementations the entire
.I key
is significant (instead of only the first
8 bytes in DES).

Warning: The key space consists of 2**56 equal 7.2e16 possible values. Exhaustive searches of this key space are possi‐
ble using massively parallel computers. Software, such as crack(1), is available which will search the portion of this
key space that is generally used by humans for passwords. Hence, password selection should, at minimum, avoid common
words and names. The use of a passwd(1) program that checks for crackable passwords during the selection process is rec‐
ommended.

.SH RETURN VALUES
On success, the encrypted password is printed on stdout. On error, non zero status is returned.
