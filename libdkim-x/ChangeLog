Build Instructions
------------------

You must have OpenSSL installed and built.

http://www.openssl.org/

For Win32,
  - Edit the make file Makefile.vc and set the OpenSSL include and lib
    paths (OPENSSL_INC and OPENSSL_LIB)
  - Run "nmake /f Makefile.vc"

For Unix,
  - Run "make"


Usage
-------

See dkim.c for an example of how to call the library.
