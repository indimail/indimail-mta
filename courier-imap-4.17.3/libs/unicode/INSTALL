Installation and usage

   Download the current version of the library from
   http://www.courier-mta.org/download.html#unicode. After unpacking the
   tarball, run the configure script, which takes the usual options, followed
   by make, then make install.

   To use the library, “#include <courier-unicode.h>” and link with
   -lunicode. The starting point is courier-unicode(7). Refer to the included
   manual pages, and the HTML version of the man pages for more information.
