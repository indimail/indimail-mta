        * Start up Netscape from Windows.

        * Select "Preferences" from the "Edit" menu

	* Click on the "Advanced" tab, then "Proxies"

	* Make sure the "Manual proxy configuration" *button* is selected

	* Press the "View.." button (a window of boxes will open)
	  
        * Click in the text-box with 'HTTP Proxy' beside it, and type in
           proxy.netsoc.ucd.ie               <DON'T press enter!>

        * To the right of this box is a smaller box labelled "Port".
          In this box, type in the number 33128

        * Click on 'ok' at the bottom of the menu, and that's it!
