Speeding up the Web
-------------------
1: (Netscape) Turn off 'Auto-load images' from the 'Options' menu
if you don't need all pictures loaded. They account for most of
the time you wait.

2: Access American sites (.com .edu .gov etc.) before lunch time.
The East coast of the USA is five hours behind; they start to
wake up around noon Irish time.

3: Access after office hours, as a lot less people will be using
the Web.

4: If there's a site with the same material nearer to Dublin, use
it instead. (the Web may seem dimensionless, but the information
still has to go through physical connections)
