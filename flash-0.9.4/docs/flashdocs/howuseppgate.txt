To set up Netscape to use PPGate, here's what to do...

        * Start up Netscape from Windows.

        * Start up telnet from Windows, and login into orca.

        * Select <The World Wide Web>, then "Ppgate".
          PPGate will give you a port number (in bold type)
          <remember this number, you'll need it later>

        * Switch back to Netscape (pressing alt-tab is a good way
                                     to do this)
        * Select "Network preferences" from the "Options" menu

	* Click on the "Proxies" tab

	* Click on the "Manual proxy configuration" switch and press the
	  "View.." button (a window of boxes will open)
	  
        * Click in the text-box with 'http proxy' beside it, and type in
           orca.netsoc.ucd.ie               <DON'T press enter!>

        * To the right of this box is a smaller box labelled "Port".
          In this box, type in that number that PPGate gave you....

        * Click on 'ok' at the bottom of the menu, and that's it!

Remember: When you've finished using netscape, you must switch back to
	your orca account and log out of orca !!
