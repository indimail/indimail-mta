Lynx for Netscape users
-----------------------
This file is to introduce Lynx to people who have already used
Netscape.

Lynx is a text-only browser that cannot display pictures or
frames, but is much faster than Netscape. You don't need to start
Windows either, and it crashes a lot less often than Netscape
(never without a *real* reason).

To start Lynx
-------------
Press 'x' in flash. (couldn't be simpler, really)

Appearance
----------
The top line shows the title of the page and your position in it.
The last 3 lines show commands and a status display.

Initially, the last two lines show command keys, and the third
last is a 'status' line. If you select 'Expert' from the Options
menu (see later), these will change to provide more technical
information.

Ordinary text is show in normal type, while links are shown
highlighted (yellow in DOS telnet).
