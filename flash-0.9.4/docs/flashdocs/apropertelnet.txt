You may have noticed that the telnet that you usually use with
Win95 is not a very good telnet.  If you want to use a better telnet,
follow these steps:

	* Open "Start", "Programs", "Applications", "Communications" .

	* Run "Run this before running Exceed for the first time".

	* Then run "Exceed V5.1.3" (in the same folder)

	* This will bring up Explorer, and on the right-hand side click
	  on "Telnet" .

	* Click on the "Host" box and type in "netsoc.ucd.ie" .
	  Click on "OK".

	* Login to netsoc as normal.  It even has colours! 

	* Hit the 'Settings' option at the top of the window, and click
	  on 'Terminal'
	  In the box that opens up, hit the 'Keyboard' tab. In the
	  'Keyboard Map File' section, hit browse.

	* You should be in the directory 'Y:\w95apps\exceed\v5.13'
	  Go into the 'Install.CSV' directory, then into the 'User'
	  directory.
	  Double-click on the 'vt.tkb' file to select it.

	* You will be back in the 'Modify Terminal Setup' window.  Hit the
	  first tab ('VT320'). In the 'Terminal Mode' box, select 'VT100'.
	  Make sure that the 'Cursor Keys as Application' box is ticked.
	  Hit 'OK'.

	* To make sure that you don't have to do this every time, you should
	  save the settings. To do this, hit 'File', then 'Save'. You will
	  be asked for the name of a file to save the settings in.
	  Just type in something like 'H:\files\telnet.hts' 
	  You can open this file the next time, if you need to.
