This file contains very simple instructions for compiling flash. If you have 
problems please try to work them out yourself and then let us know what 
needed changing and may include you contribution in future releases, or 
alternatively contact us and we will see what we can do to help!

Basically it should be

./configure; make; make install

./configure --enable-maildir will enable Maildir support.

If you have trouble using 'make install' it may be because configure could not 
find an install program in your path. I have included a section in the Makefile 
to do the install with good old 'mkdir' and 'cp' so uncomment this if you have 
problems.
