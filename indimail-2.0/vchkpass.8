vchkpass \- checkpassword program for IndiMail authentication

.SH SYNOPSYS
.PP
\fBvchkpass\fR \fBalternate_checkpassword_program(s)\fR \fB/bin/false\fR
.PP
\fBsystpass\fR \fBalternate_checkpassword_program(s)\fR \fB/bin/false\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBvchkpass\fR and \fBsystpass\fR supports authentication for ESMTP AUTH option in \fBqmail-smtpd(8)\fR,
allowing the LOGIN, PLAIN, and CRAM-MD5, CRAM-SHA1, CRAM-RIPEMD, DIGEST-MD5 AUTH types.
\fBvchkpass\fR looks up userid in IndiMail's Virtual Database while \fBsystpass\fR looks
up userids in the systems authentication database (/etc/passwd or /etc/shadow).
.PP
As reflected in the \fBqmail-smtpd(8)\fR man page, \fBqmail-smtpd(8)\fR must be invoked with
three arguments: hostname, path of the vchkpass/systpass program, and subprogram. If these
arguments are missing, \fBqmail-smtpd(8)\fR will not advertise availability of AUTH.
.PP
\fBvchkpass\fR/\fBsystpass\fR reads descriptor 3 through end of file and then closes
descriptor 3. There must be at most 512 bytes of data before end of file. If it invokes an
\fBalternate_checkpassword_program\fR, it opens a pipe duping the read descriptor as 3 for
the \fBalternate_checkpassword_program\fR. The write end of the pipe is duped to descriptor 4
and the data which was earlier read on descriptor 3 is written back on descriptor 4.
The alternate program is invoked when vchkpass doesn't support authentication for the
supplied login name.
.PP
For LOGIN, PLAIN AUTH types, the information supplied on descriptor 3 is a login name
terminated by \\0 and password terminated by \\0. \fBvchkpass\fR encrypts the password using
cyrpt(3) routine and compares it against the value present in the passwd database. The encrypted
password can be in DES, MD5, SHA-256 or SHA-512 hash.
.PP
For CRAM-MD5, CRAM-SHA1, CRAM-RIPEMD, DIGEST-MD5 AUTH type, the information supplied on
descriptor 3 is a login name terminated by \\0, a cram-md5 challenge terminated by \\0, and
a cram-md5 response terminated by \\0.  \fBvchkpass\fR/\fBsystpass\fR encrypts the
challenge with keyed MD5 using passwords from passwd database. It's compared with
response (3rd parameter) and if they are the same then vchkpass/systpass uses execvp to
run subprogram with the given arguments. If they differ then it returns -1.
.PP
If challenge and response differ, \fBvchkpass\fR/\fBsystpass\fR exits 1. If \fBvchkpass\fR/\fBsystpass\fR
is misused, it may instead exit 2. If there is a temporary problem checking the password,
\fBvchkpass\fR/\fBsystpass\fR exits 111.
.PP
hostname is simply used to form the CRAM-MD5, CRAM-SHA1, CRAM-RIPEMD, DIGEST-MD5 challenge.
\fBqmail-smtpd\fR invokes \fBvchkpass\fR, feeding it the username and password, in the case
of LOGIN or PLAIN, or the username, challenge, and response, in the case of CRAM-MD5,
CRAM-SHA1, CRAM-RIPEMD, DIGEST-MD5.  If the user checks out, \fBvchkpass\fR/\fBsystpass\fR
exits with a status of 0 for the user to be authenticated. Otherwise, subprogram should
exit with a non-zero status, or call an alternate checkpassword program. The last
subprogram can usually be /usr/bin/false (or /bin/false, depending on your flavor of OS).

.PP
\fBvchkpass\fR does not authenticate if user is inactive. A user is active if one logs in using
IMAP or POP3 protocol. If \fBALLOW_INACTIVE\fR is defined, \fBvchkpass\fR will proceed regardless
of the user's active or inactive status.

If the environment variable \fBDOMAIN_LIMITS\fR is defined, \fBvchkpass\fR validates domain
expiry and password expiry set by \fBvmoduser(1)\fR program.

\fBvchkpass\fR can execute a script defined by environment variable \fBPOSTAUTH\fR
