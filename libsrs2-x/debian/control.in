Description: SRS email address rewriting engine
 libsrs2 is the next generation SRS library. SPF verifies that the
 Sender address of a mail matches (according to some policy) the
 client IP address which submits the mail. When a mail is forwarded,
 the sender address must be rewritten to comply with SPF policy. The
 Sender Rewriting Scheme, or SRS, provides a standard for this
 rewriting which is not vulnerable to attacks by spammers.
