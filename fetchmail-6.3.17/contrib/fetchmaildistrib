#
# The central fetchmail database, /etc/fetchmail, contains all accounts that
# are to be fetched by the root's daemon. Often, a user desires quicker
# access (e.g., when testing some email path). In such cases, the destination
# user (marked as is USER here in the poll lines) should set up a ~/.fetchmailrc
# for himself. This scripts generates such lines from the central file.

# From stdin, select poll lines for user $1
