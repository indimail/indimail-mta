INSTALL---------------------------------------------------------------

Very simple (as root)...

	make
	make install
	
	[ Make install will install the ripmime binary to /usr/local/bin, 
	there are no other support files required. ]
	
To use ripMIME...

	If you have an MIME encoded archive (say from sendmail's output) 
	called recvmail001.mime and you wish to unpack it to a directory
	(which already exists) called "/var/tmp/unpack", then use ripMIME
	as follows...
	
		ripmime -i recvmail001.mime -d /var/tmp/unpack
		
It's truly that simple.

--- If you want more PERFORMANCE out of ripMIME (most people will), you can
	select some compile flags in the Makefile which suit your CPU better,
	ie, for recent Pentiums/Celerons, you can use

		-Wall -O3 -march=i686
