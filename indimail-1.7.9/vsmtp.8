.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBvsmtp\fR sets up artificial routes for \fBqmail-remote(8)\fR to be able to deliver mails to the
mailstore on host \fIhost\fR and domain \fIdomain_name\fR. This route is used by \fBqmail-remote(8)\fR
to send mails using SMTP or QMTP for clustered domains. For all other domains the control/smtproutes or
control/qmtproutes is consulted. This routing information is stored in MySQL on a host which by nomenclature
is called the \fBcontrol host\fR.

.PP
The \fIcontrol host\fR is defined by the control files \fIhost.master\fR / \fIhost.cntrl\fR or the environment
variables \fBCNTRL_HOST\fR, \fBCNTRL_USER\fR, \fBCNTRL_PASS\fR, \fBCNTRL_VPORT\fR or \fBCNTRL_SOCKET\fB.
