.SH NAME
dotls \- TLS/SSL protocol wrapper
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBdotls\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] \fB\fIprog\fB\fR \fB\fIarg\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBdotls\fR program is used by applications to encrypt a
network connection using SSL/TLS, without having the application
deal with the gory details of SSL/TLS.

.PP
\fBdotls\fR is not usually run directly from the command line.
An application typically creates a network connection, then runs
\fBdotls\fR with appropriate options to encrypt the network
connection with SSL/TLS. \fBdotls\fR can also do opportunistic
SSL/TLS for smtp in server mode.

\fBdotls\fR can be run under \fBtcpserver\fR(1) to provide SSL/TLS or
opportunistic TLS for qmail-smtpd, qmail-pop3d. This is known as
\fBserver mode\fR.

\fBdotls\fR can be run under \fBtcpclient\fR(1) to connect to any SSL/TLS
enabled server. This is knwn is \fBclient mode\fR. This gets enabled
when you use \fB\-T\fR or the \fB\-C\fR options.

\fBdotls\fR is not needed by indimail-mta as all features offered by
\fBdotls\fR are built-in tcpserver(1) and tcpclient(1) provided by
ucspi-tcp package from indimail-mta git repo at
https://github.com/mbhangui/indimail-mta/tree/master/ucspi-tcp-x

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-n \fIcertfile\fB\fR
Use \fIcertfile\fR as the certificate
The certificate to use and is required for SSL/TLS servers.
\fIcertfile\fR must not be world-readable. This option overrides
environment variable TLS_CERTFILE.

.TP
\fB-t\fR \fItimeout\fB\fR
Timeout after \fItimeout\fR seconds if no data is received

.TP
.B \-s \fIstartlsType
Specify smtp, pop3 or imap for \fIstarttlsType\fR. In this mode,
\fBdotls\fR will offer STARTTLS extension. It will initiate SSL/TLS
negotation only when iit receives \fBSTARTTLS\fR command from client.
Currently, only \fBsmtp\fR is supported.

.TP
.B \-C
\fBclient\fR mode. In this mode, \fBdotls\fR acts as a tls client,
reading fd 0 for input and using fd 1 for output.

.TP
.B \-T
\fBclient\fR mode. In this mode, \fBdotls\fR acts as a tls client,
reading fd 6 for input and using fd 7 for output.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
\fBdotls\fR reads the following environment variables in
order to configure the SSL/TLS protocol:
.TP
.B CERTSDIR
Sub-directory relative to @qsysconfdir@, having servercert.pem.
Default is @qsysconfdir@/certs.

.TP
\fBTLS_CIPHER_LIST=\fIcipherList\fB\fR
A set of OpenSSL cipher strings. Multiple ciphers contained in a
string should be separated by a colon.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBtcpclient\fR(1),
\fBtcpserver\fR(1)
