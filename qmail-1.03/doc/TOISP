Situation: You would like outgoing mail from your computer to be sent to
the mail.big.isp SMTP server when you dial in.

These instructions assume that serialmail and ucspi-tcp/tcpclient are
already installed on your computer.


1. Put :alias-ppp into /var/qmail/control/virtualdomains, and give
   qmail-send a SIGHUP.

2. As the alias user (not as root): Run

      maildirmake ~/pppdir

   and put ./pppdir/ (including the final slash) into
   ~/.qmail-ppp-default. Now all outgoing messages will be stored in
   ~alias/pppdir.

3. Make sure that mail.big.isp allows relaying from your computer's IP
   address.

4. To send messages to mail.big.isp, run
   
      maildirsmtp ~alias/pppdir alias-ppp- 1.2.3.4 `hostname`
   
   Replace 1.2.3.4 with the IP address of mail.big.isp.

   For faster transfers, if your ISP has set up a QMTP server, run

      maildirqmtp ~alias/pppdir alias-ppp- 1.2.3.4

   instead.
