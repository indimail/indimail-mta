Situation: Your computer dials in to a UNIX shell account at
mail.big.isp. You would like mail for the domain virt.dom to be received
by mail.big.isp and then forwarded to the SMTP server on your computer.

These instructions assume that serialmail and ucspi-tcp/tcpclient are
already installed on mail.big.isp.


1. Make sure that there is an MX record for virt.dom:

      virt.dom IN MX 10 mail.big.isp

   Now any host on the Internet with mail for virt.dom will send it to
   mail.big.isp.

2. Make sure that your ISP puts virt.dom into
   /var/qmail/control/rcpthosts. Now qmail-smtpd will accept mail for
   virt.dom.

3. Make sure that your ISP puts virt.dom:yourunixaccount-ppp into
   /var/qmail/control/virtualdomains, and gives qmail-send a SIGHUP. Now
   all messages for whatever@virt.dom will be delivered to
   yourunixaccount-ppp-whatever.

4. Log into yourunixaccount. Run

      maildirmake ~/pppdir

   and put ./pppdir/ (including the final slash) into
   ~/.qmail-ppp-default. Now all messages for virt.dom will be delivered
   into pppdir.

5. To retrieve messages from pppdir next time you log in, run

      maildirsmtp ~/pppdir yourunixaccount-ppp- 1.2.3.4 `hostname`

   Replace 1.2.3.4 with the IP address of your computer. Messages will
   be transferred from pppdir to your computer by SMTP.

   For faster transfers, set up a QMTP server on your computer, and run

      maildirqmtp ~/pppdir yourunixaccount-ppp- 1.2.3.4

   instead.
