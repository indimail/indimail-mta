                LICENSE.GPL-2 and LICENSE.BSD.
                More liberal licensing is available, for example for inclusion in
                a commercial product which does not wish to advertise its use of
                this software. Users should contact Shevek at <srs@anarres.org> with
                specific requirements for licensing or support. Be optimistic. Such
                requirements can almost certainly be met.
