1. PURPOSE
----------

The SPAMCONTROL patch is intended for environments where some local
E-Mail systems are used (eg. Lotus Notes) and QMAIL 1.03 is facilitated
as a RELAY to the Internet. This may be called an E-Mail Gateway.

In this case, QMAIL-SMTPD receives all OUTGOING E-Mails from the local 
environment and delivers them to MTAs on the Internet.
Additionally, QMAIL-SMTPD should solely receive those INCOMING
Internet E-Mails which are targeted for the local E-Mail systems. 
In particular, QMAIL should not forward any E-Mail to third party
MTAs.

In a minimal configuration QMAIL acts as an SMTP RELAY and depends
on the appropriate settings in the ./control files, in particular
./control/rcpthosts which will turn QMAIL into a selective RELAY.

The SPAMCONTROL patch improves the QMAIL-SMTPD's filtering capabilities
as a selective relay. QMAIL can advised to ignore (not to invoke 
QMAIL-QUEUE for) E-Mails from particular senders and/or for recipients. 
Filtering is done analyzing the E-Mail SMTP ENVELOPE SENDER (MAIL from:)
and/or RECIPIENT (RCPT to:) address.

This version of the SPAMCONTROL patch requiers TCPSERVER to start 
QMAIL-SMTPD in conjunction with SPLOGGER.

The SPAMCONTROL patch enables logging for rejected E-Mails by means
of QMAIL-SMTPD.

With the SPAMCONTROL patch, QMAIL 1.03 complies to RFC 1870 and 2505.


1.1 RELAYCLIENT and RCPTHOSTS
-----------------------------

Invoking the environment variable $RELAYCLIENT enhances the logic of
QMAIL-SMTPD. Now, in addition the REMOTEIP of the SENDER is evaluated
and tested against the value of the environment variable $RELAYCLIENT. 
1) If the REMOTEIP of the SENDER failes the test, ./control/rcpthosts
   and ./control/morercpthosts is checked and the E-Mail is ONLY
   relayed if it's RECIPIENT address corresponds with the contents 
   of one those files.
2) If the REMOTEIP of the SENDER passes the test (which means 
   usually the SENDER originates from your -trusted- Subnet/Domain)
   no further tests are applied (except for BAD*).

The RELAYCLIENT patch extends this feature by means of the files
./control/relayclients and/or ./control/relaydomains.
This allows you to include serveral IP-Addresses, IP-Subnets, and/or 
Domains to be accepted for unrestricted relaying.

This behavior corresponds to the suggestions (ยง2.1) for Anti-Spam MTAs
(RFC 2505).

CAUTION: If you apply the environment variable $RELAYCLIENT 
./Control/relayclients and ./control/relaydomains become obsolete!

See the attaced SPAMCONTROL.pdf file for more information.


1.2 TCPSERVER and SPAMCONTROL
-----------------------------

If you use TCPSERVER with the $RELAYCLIENT environment variable set
to some value, its fine also. In this case ./control/relayclients
and ./control/relaydomains are ineffective and the original logic
is still valid (see 1.1).


1.3 RELAYCLIENT vs. SPAMCONTROL
-------------------------------

Both enhancements are independent. You can keep your existing
QMAIL control file environment (including the files ./rcpthosts
and ./morercpthosts) intact after applying this patch while taking
advantage from the additional SPAM control files and the logging
capabilities.


1.4 RELAYMAILFROM
-----------------

Taken from Chris Johnson, additional E-Mail senders are allowed 
to relay by means of analyzing their envelope sender address. 
This is "not secure--it's trivial to forge a message's envelope
sender" and somehow complementary to the relaydomain mechanism.

New control file:

- /var/qmail/control/relaymailfrom

This gives the ability to enable ROAMING users.
Users - identified by their E-Mail addresses included in here -
are accepted to use this MTA as RELAY.
Unlike the original implementation, RELAYMAILFROM can be used in 
connection with RELAYCLIENT and RELAYDOMAIN.
This mechanism works independent of the $RELAYCLIENT environment
variable. 


2. ABOUT SPAM E-MAIL
--------------------

Even if you use (e.g. QMAIL as) a restricted SMTP relay
SPAMMERS may manipulate either the SENDER (MAIL from:) or the
RECIPIENT (RCPT to:) address of E-Mails, making your MTA believe

1) that this E-Mail is originated by itself,
2) accepting it and send the SPAM E-Mail to a third party (target) MTA,
   which in turn sees this E-Mail to originate from your MTA/Domain,
3) turning your MTA effectively into a host for SPAM E-Mails.


2.1 RBLSMTPD vs. SPAMCONTROL PATCH
----------------------------------

In general, there exist two methods to reject E-Mail from a
potential SPAMMER:

1) Employing the RPLSMTPD patch to enhance TCPSERVER calling
   ORBS and/or others to check whether or not a SENDER/SMTP RELAY
   is blacklisted. Thus, the SENDER is checked even before
   QMAIL-SMTPD is invoked.
2) The SPAMCONTROL patch, which enhances QMAIL-SMTPD to give you 
   additional filter capabilities to reject incoming E-Mail by means
   of the typical header extensions of the SENDER and/or RECIPIENT 
   address of SPAM E-Mail.

With the SPAMCONTROL patch you don't fight specific SENDERs 
and/or SMTP MTAs but rather the METHODS potential SPAMMERs use. 
However, you are able to filter individual sites/addresses as well. 
This is in your own responsibility and you don't need to rely on 
third-party information which might not be adequat for your site.

And again, you are free to combine the RBLSMPTD and the SPAMCONTROL
patch if you think you need it.


2.2 CANNONICAL METHOD FILTER for SPAM E-MAIL
--------------------------------------------

Let's assume your MTA's FQDN is mta.domain.com and has
IP address "12.34.56.78".
The inverse DNS Name becomes "78.56.34.12.in-addr.arpa".

Include the following canonical filters into the control files:

./control/FILE   expression
---------------------------------------------------------------
badmailfrom      @12.34.56.78
badrcptto        @12.34.56.78
badmailpatterns  *12.34.56.78*
badrcptpatterns  *12.34.56.78*
badmailpatterns  *78.56.34.12.in-addr.arpa* 
badrcptpatterns  *78.56.34.12.in-addr.arpa*


SPAM E-Mails with the "PERCENTHACK" can be eliminated by adding "*%*"
to the ./control/badmailpatterns and ./control/badrcptpatterns file. 
Any E-Mails including a "%" sign in the SENDER and/or RECIPIENT
address will be rejected.

Starting with this version, the E-Mail addresses are evaluated
case insensitive! (Thanks to Manon Goo)

The filtering logic can be picked up from the SPAMCONTROL.pdf file.

Please consider that evaluating the *PATTERNS takes a lot more CPU cycles
then employing BADMAILFROM and BADRCPTTO. However, this has to be
compared with the amount of processing to be spend by QMAIL-QUEUE, 
QMAIL-RSPAWN and QMAIL-SEND, and of course your worries!

Control characters:

- Exclamation mark (!): The WILDMAT filter allows you to INCLUDE
  particular clients/addresses simply putting an exclamation
  mark (!) as first character in the line.
- Asterisk (*): General pattern matching character.
- Backslash (\): Literal expression of following character, eg. \[.

For more details about the WILDMAT logic, have a look at README.wildmat.


2.3 EXITING THE SMTP-SESSION IN CASE OF SPAM
--------------------------------------------

With this version of SPAMCONTROL, recognizing an invalid (i.e. SPAM) address,
QMAIL-SMTPD exist after receiving the RCPT TO:, thus the potiential SPAMMER
has to invoke a new TCP session. 
Thanks to Manon Goo (root@host.manon.de) for this suggestion.


This is different wrt the previous version where qmail-smtpd returns an SMTP
error but silently was still accepting new E-Mail addresses within the current
session.


2.4 TARPITTING
--------------

I have included Chris Johnson's TARPITTING patch into SPAMCONTROL:
"What is tarpitting? It's the practice of inserting a small sleep in
a SMTP session for reach RCPT TO after some set number of RCPT TOs.
The idea is to that spammers who would hand your SMTP server a single
message wiht a long list of RCPT TOs. If a spammer were to attempt to
use your server to relay a message, say, 10,000 recipients, and you
inserted a five-second delay for each recipient after teh fiftieth,
the spammer would be 'tarpitted', and would most likely assume that
the connection had stalled and give up."

Two additional control files can be employed:

- tarpitcount: is the number of RCPT TOs to accept before starting
               tarpitting and defaults 0 (no tarpitting).
- tarpitdelay: is the number of seconds of delay to introduce after
               each subsequent RCPT TO. Default is 5 seconds.

Instead, the environment variable TARPITCOUNT and TARPITDELAY can
be used.


2.5 QMAIL's BEHAVIOR on [IP-Addresses]
--------------------------------------

Although it is not recommended to use IP-Addresses in SMTP E-Mail, 
it is used in particular by SPAMMERs, and in addition by ORBS for
testing the MTA's blocking mechanisms.

We have to distinguish between the following cases for IP-Adresses
in RCPT to:

1) RCPT to: <any@IP-Address>    => forwarded to "any@[IP-Address]"
2) RCPT to: <any@[IP-Address]>  => forwarded to "any@IP-Address"  
3) RCPT to: <any@12.34.56.78>   => forwarded to "any@12.34.56.78"
4) RCPT to: <any@[12.34.56.78]> => received for "any@mta.domain.com"
5) RCPT to: <any@[127.0.0.1]>   => received for "any@mta.domain.com"

This means, QMAIL performs already within QMAIL-SMTPD a substitution
for it's own address and in particular the LOOPBACK address.
This substition is done BEFORE the filters are applied!


2.6 GENERIC ADDRESSES
---------------------

According to the discussion of SPAM E-Mail, avoid including generic
addresses of your MTA in the QMAIL control files, i.e. localhost
and/or the loopback address (127.0.0.1). This would make QMAIL
accepting any incoming E-Mails with this generic address.
In other words: For all QMAIL control files which are evaluated 
with POSITIVE filtering logic be as specific/restrictive as possible.

Unfortunately, some other E-Mail tools like FETCHMAIL depend on those.


2.7 RETURN CODES for REJECTED SPAM E-MAILS
------------------------------------------

According to RFC 2505 ยง2.13 I implemented the following QMAIL SMTP Return Codes:

1) "553 sorry, that domain isn't allowed to be relayed thru this MTA (#5.7.1)"
2) "554 sorry, your envelope sender is in my badmailfrom list (#5.7.1)"
3) "555 sorry, your envelope recipient is in my badrecipients list (#5.7.1)"

A discussion about the implications can be found in RFC 2505.

An explanation for the "Mail System Status Codes" (eg. the numbers #5.7.1)
can be found in RFC 1893.


2.8 LOGGING SPAM
----------------

QMAIL-SMTPD logs rejected E-Mail in the MAILLOG by means of SPLOGGER. 
In this version, it is requierd to call QMAIL-SMTPD from TCPSERVER !
Trying to use it with INETD or XINETD will show the log-output
on the client console!


A typical TCPSERVER start script:

#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/bin/tcpserver -v -R -H -u 7791 -g 2108 QMAIL_IP_ADDRESS smtp \
    /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd 2>&1 | /var/qmail/bin/splogger smtpd &


In the MAILLOG the following information is displayed:

- reason (verbose)
- IP-Address of SENDER
- SENDER address of E-Mail
- RECIPIENT address of E-Mail

This corresponds to ยง2.4 of RFC 2505.

Since SPLOGGER is now facilitated, ACCUSTAMP time information is 
included.

See the new man-page of qmail-log(5).


2.9 ON-THE-FLY MODS of CONTROL FILES
------------------------------------

If you apply this SPAMCONTROL patch, any change in the QMAIL-SMTPD
control files  - including all the BAD* - are effective on the fly!
Thus, as soon as you recognize any SPAM activity analyzing your MAILLOG
you can block it immediately applying the appropriate filters.
However, any SPAM E-Mail already in the queue will be processed further.


3. DNS CHECKS for ENVELOPE SENDER
---------------------------------

The SPAMCONTROL Patch includes now the MFCHECK Patch with some enhancements.
Thus, QMAIL-SMTPD performs not only a DNS MX look-up for the recipient but rather
additionally for the sender of an incoming E-Mail (based on the addresses in 
the E-Mail's envelope). Results:

1) QMAIL-SMPTD verifies the existence of the sender's domain.
2) QMAIL-SMTPD rejects E-Mails with bogus hostnames/domains in the envelope sender
  (see 2.5).
3) QMAIL-SMTPD writes a log-entry for rejected E-Mails (see 2.7).


3.1 GLOBALLY DISABLEING the DNS CHECK
-------------------------------------

Invoking the environment variable $NODNSCHEK disables globally the DNS check
for the envelope's sender. Thus, QMAIL-SMTPD acts in the conventional way.
See attached sample for xinetd.conf.spamcontrol.


3.2 EXCLUDING ADRESSES for DNS CHECK
------------------------------------

By means of the new control file ./control/nodnscheck individual sender
addresses and/or domains can be excluded from the envelope sender DNS check.
Recommendations:

1) In order to reduce DNS traffic you can include local and/or trusted domains
   (e.g. @hotmail.com).
2) In case of a misconfigured MTA and/or DNS RR include those here in order to
   allow the reception of E-Mails from those sites.


3.3 RETURN CODES for rejected E-MAILS for missing MX-RECORDS
------------------------------------------------------------

qmail-smtpd will return the following SMTP message to the SMTP client:

1) "552 sorry, your envelope sender domain must exist (#5.7.1)"



4. SMTP SIZE COMMAND
--------------------

I included Will Harris' SIZE patch to make qmail-smtpd fully RFC 1870 complient.
Based on the values in the control file

- /var/qmail/control/databytes

qmail-smtpd will respect now the required "MAIL FROM: < ...> SIZE=xxx" syntax.
This depends of course on the ability of the SMTP client.
Nevertheless, qmail-smtpd checks the size of the incoming message anyway.


4.1 ESMTP SIZE RETURN CODES
---------------------------

For incoming E-Mails which exceed the message size values (in Bytes) defined in 

- /var/qmail/control/databytes 
or via the 
- $DATABYTES
environment variable, qmail-smtpd returns the RFC 1870 complient message:

1) "552 sorry, that message size exceeds my databytes limit (#5.3.4)" 


5. HOWTO
--------

In case your E-Mail environment complies to the assumption in (1.) 
do the following:

1.  Stop your QMAIL system (receive and send).
2.  Remove SMTP/POP3 connection to be services by INETD/XINETD.
    Employ TCPSERVER instead.                                      
3.  Follow the INSTALL.spamcontrol instructions.
4.  Edit the file ./control/relayclients and include the
    IP-Addresses of your local subnets.
    (IP-Adresses for SENDERS which are relayed thru QMAIL-SMTPD).
5.  Instead, you can use ./control/relaydomains and
    put your domain name in here. But I don't recommend this.
6.  If necessary, you can enable relaying for individual E-Mail
    MAIL From: address and include those in ./control/relaymailfrom.
7.  Edit the files
     ./control/badmailfrom,   
     ./control/badmailpatterns,
     ./control/badrcptto,
     ./control/badrcptpatterns 
     ./control/nodnscheck 
     ./control/tarpitcount to your needs.
    See above samples.
8.  Restart QMAIL.
9.  Check your configuration by means of qmail-showctl.
    It is a good idea to pipe the output of that command 
    with timestamp information to a file.
10. If you are already blacklisted, inform those sites that
    you don't act as an OPEN RELAY anymore.
11. Watch the QMAIL behavior by means of the SYSLOG information.

If it doesn't, skip item 4. and 5. and stay with your QMAIL control
files.

Good luck!
