.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBplugtest(1)\fR tests SMTP plugins for \fBqmail-smtpd(8)\fR. By default \plugtest(1)\fR
looks for plugins in QMAILHOME/plugins directory. You can change this by defining
\fBPLUGINDIR\fR environment variable. You can also load multiple plugins by creating
smtpd-plugin0.so, smtpd-plugin1.so, and so on. plugtest(1) uses \fBdlopen(3)\fR to open
the plugins and execute the MAIL, RCPT & DATA plugins defined in the shared library
representing a plugin.
After loading the plugin, the function \fIplugin_init()\fR is executed. The function to
be executed can be changed by setting environment variable \fBSMTP_PLUGIN_SYM\fR. The
function \fIplugin_init()\fR should return a PLUGIN structure (see plugin_init(3) for details).
The PLUGIN structure returns pointer to three functions to be executed in the MAIL FROM,
RCPT and DATA phase of SMTP.
