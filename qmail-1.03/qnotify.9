.SH NAME
qnotify \- respond to Message Disposition Notifications
.SH SYNOPSIS
in
.BR .qmail :
.B |qnotify
[-h]
[-n]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBqnotify\fR(1) reads an rfc822 email on stdin and generates a MDN as required by
RFC3798. 
\fBqnotify\fR(1) uses environment variable \fBSENDER\fR, \fBRPLINE\fR or \fBReturn-Path\fR
header to compare the address with Disposition header. By default, \fBqnotify\fR uses 
\fBDisposition-Notification-To\fR header. You can use a different header by setting
the environment variable \fBDISPOSITION_HEADER\fR. \fBqnotify\fR(1) also uses the environment
variable \fBRECIPIENT\fR to generate the MDN. \fBqnotify\fR(1) silently exits with zero return
status in case it does not get the required information from the environment variables or
the headers in the email.

\fBqnotify\fR(1) uses \fBqmail-queue\fR(8) to queue the Return Receipt and uses environment
variables according to files in QMAILHOME/control/defaultqueue directory.
