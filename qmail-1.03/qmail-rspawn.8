.TH qmail-rspawn 8
.SH NAME
qmail-rspawn \- schedule remote deliveries
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-rspawn
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qmail-rspawn
reads a series of remote delivery commands from descriptor 0,
invokes
.B qmail-remote
to perform the deliveries,
and prints the results to descriptor 1. If the environment variable QMAILREMOTE
is defined, the executable defined by QMAILREMOTE is invoked instead.

.B qmail-rspawn
invokes
.B qmail-remote
asynchronously,
so the results may not be in the same order as the commands. For a clustered domain, it queries
.B hostcntrl
in
.B MySQL(1)
to figure out the host where it needs to send out the mail using SMTP / QMTP. It sets the SMTPROUTE
environment variable if the environment variable ROUTES is set as "smtp". It sets the QMTPROUTE
environment variable if the environment variable ROUTES is set as "qmtp". To turn off this behaviour
of setting dynamically SMTPROUTE/QMTPROUTE variable, set the environment variable ROUTES=static.
If SMTPROUTE is set
.B
qmail-remote
uses SMTPROUTE variables instead of control/smtproutes and uses SMTP.
If QMTPROUTE is set
.B
qmail-remote
uses QMTPROUTE variables instead of control/qmtproutes and uses QMTP. \fBqmail-remote\fR prefers
QMTP over SMTP.
