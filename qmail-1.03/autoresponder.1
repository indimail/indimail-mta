.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qmail-autoresponder
is a RFC 3834 compliant responder to automatically respond to emails.
.B qmail-autoresponder
creates temporary files in \fIdirectory\fR to track sender's rates. If more than NUM messages are
received from the same sender within TIME seconds of each other, no response is sent. This
program must be run by qmail. Put "|qmail-autoresponder \fImessagefile\fR \fIdirectory\fR" into
your ".qmail" file before other delivery instructions. \fImessagefile\fR is a pre-formatted
response, including headers, and \fIdirectory\fR is the directory into which rate-limiting
information will be stored. By default
.B qmail-autoresponder
will reply with the address of the recipient. This behaviour can be altered by setting the
environment variable SERVICE_RESPONDER. The value of SERVICE_RESPONDER can be set to a friendly
name which will appear in the 'from address'. For a service responder, the address will be
determined by the \fIbouncefrom\fR and \fIbouncehost\fR control files. The Return-Path however in
both the cases will be null to prevent brain damaged MTA like M$Exchange to send bounces/reply to
autoresponder.

.B qmail-autoresponder
replaces occurrences of the following special characters in the \fImessagefile\fR.

.IP \[bu] 2
%S - Subject of the original mail
.IP \[bu]
%D - Date header in the original mail
