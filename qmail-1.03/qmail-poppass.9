.SH "NAME"
qmail-poppass \- change passwords from across the network using
the
.B setpassword
interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-poppass
[
.I hostname
.I checkprogram
.I subprogram
.I subprogram
]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B qmail-poppass
provides the
.B poppassd
protocol to allow users to change their passwords from remote locations.

.PP
.B qmail-poppass
uses the
.B checkpassword
interface for authencation and uses the
.B setpassword
interface for setting the password.
.B checkpassword
provides a simple, uniform password-checking interface to all root
applications. It is suitable for use by applications such as login, ftpd, and pop3d.
.B setpassword
provides a simple, uniform password-setting interface to all root applications. It is suitable for use by
applications such as pop3d, imapd.

.PP
.IR checkprogram ,
.I subprogram
should be
.B checkpassword
compatible programs.
.B qmail-poppass
invokes
.IR checkprogram ,
which reads on file descriptor 3 the username, a 0 byte, the password,
another 0 byte, and a final two 0 bytes.
.I checkprogram
invokes
.I subprogram
upon unsuccessful authentication, passing the same data (read earlier on descriptor 3) on a pipe with file descriptor 4
as the write end and file descriptor 3 as the read end.
.I subprogram
should read file descriptor 3 and should in turn return 0 to
.BR qmail-poppass
on successful authentication.
.B qmail-poppass
will reject the authentication attempt if it receives a nonzero return
value from
.I checkprogram
or
.IR subprogram .
There can be multiple
.I subprograms
for a particular type of authentication. The last
.I subprogram
should typically be /bin/false or /usr/bin/false depending on your Operating System.

.PP
.B qmail-poppass
sleeps 5 seconds after an unsuccessful password
change attempt. This feature is designed to make brute force attacks
against passwords harder to perform.

.PP
To be able to change passwords,
.B qmail-poppass
needs a
.B setpassword
compatible program. This can be specified by setting the
.B PASSWORD_COMMAND
environment variable.

.EX
PASSWORD_COMMAND="QMAILHOME/sbin/vsetpass /bin/false"
.EE

.SH "LOGGING"
Logging is done to descriptor 2.
.B qmail-poppass
logs all password change attempts whether they are successful or not.

.SH "EXAMPLE CLIENT-SERVER CONVERSATION"
All messages passed between server and client are text based allowing
a client session to be easily mimicked with telnet. Using telnet, 
changing a user's password would look like this:

	Connected to localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1).
.br
	Escape character is '^]'.
.br
	200 indimail.org hello, who are you?\\r\\n
.br
	user <username>\\r\\n
.br
	200 Your password please.\\r\\n
.br
	pass <current password>
.br
	200 Your new password please.\\r\\n
.br
	newpass <new password>\\r\\n
.br
	200 Password changed, thank-you.\\r\\n
.br
	quit\\r\\n
.br
	200 Bye.\\r\\n
.br
	Connection closed by foreign host.
