.SH NAME
spawn-filter \- Interceptor for qmail-local / qmail-remote
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B spawn-filter args
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B spawn-filter
is a \fBqmail-local\fR / \fBqmail-remote\fR interceptor to help qmail run custom filters on email
being sent to \fBqmail-local\fR / \fBqmail-remote\fR. It can run any filter which reads
messages on fd 0 and writes the output on fd 1.  Whatever is output on fd 1, will be the
message that will be delivered to the destination.  The filter can be turned on individually
for local and remote mails by defining, \fBQMAILLOCAL\fR and \fBQMAILREMOTE\fR
environment variables, to the path of \fBspawn-filter\fR respectively in \fBqmail-send\fR's
supervise or rc script. For spam filtering you can additionally, set the environment variable
\fBSPAMFILTER\fR.  If \fBspawn-filter\fR is invoked as \fBqmail-local\fR, it executes the original
\fBqmail-local\fR or \fBqmail-remote\fR after running the custom filter.  \fBspawn-filter\fR unsets
\fBQMAILREMOTE\fR when it runs as \fBqmail-local\fR. Similarly, it unsets \fBQMAILLOCAL\fR when
it runs as \fBqmail-remote\fR. This is useful in scripts to figure out whether \fBspawn-filter\fR
is running as \fBqmail-local\fR or \fBqmail-remote\fR.

Filters can be run by defining the environment variable
.B FILTERARGS
or by using the control file
.B filterargs
(see below).
.B spawn-filter
uses /bin/sh to run the filter (with arguments) specified by the
.B FILTERARGS
environment variable (or the control defined in the control file
.B filterargs
).
The environment variable
.B FILTERARGS
apply to both local and remote mails. For individual domain level control, it is best to set
using the control file \fBfilterargs\fR (see below the section on control files).
The environment variable
.B FILTERARGS
takes precedence over the control file.

.B spawn-filter
sets multiple environment variables which can be conveniently used in programs/scripts
which get invoked by setting
.B FILTERARGS
environment variable or by rules in the control file
.BR filterargs .
See the section on \fBEnvironment Variables\fR below.

.SH Control Files

.TP 5
.I filterargs
The format of this file is of the form
\fBdomain:args\fR for both local and remote mails. \fBdomain:remote:args\fR
for remote mails and \fBdomain:local:args\fR for local mails. This control
file can be used to setup additional filters after running
the SPAM filters (See Section on Spam Filtering).

.EX
indimail.org:remote:QMAILHOME/bin/dk-filter
.EE

The sequence in which the filter program is run is given below
.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 3
create two pipes and fork
.IP \n+[step]
dup write end of the first pipe to descriptor 1, dup write end of the second pipe to descriptor 2 in the child and exec the filter program
.IP \n+[step]
dup read end of the pipe to descriptor 0 in parent and exec qmail-local for local mails and qmail-remote for remote mails.
.IP \n+[step]
Wait for filter to exit and read read end of second pipe for any error messages.
.IP \n+[step]
Report success or failure

This gives the ability for the any filter program to read the mail message from descriptor 0 before
passing it to qmail-local/qmail-remote through the pipe.

.PP
The other control files that
.B spawn-filter
uses are

.TP 5
.I databytes
Maximum size of mail that will be accepted before passing it to
.B qmail-remote
or
.B qmail-local

If the environment variable
.B DATABYTES
is set, it overrides
.IR databytes .
The value of databytes determines the maximum size of a message that
.B spawn-filter
will accept.

.TP 5
.I fromd.envrules
Specific environment variables can be set for specific senders.
The format of this file is of the form                                       
pat:envar1=val,envar2=val,...]
where pat is a regular expression which matches a sender. envar1, envar2
are list of environment variables to be set. If
.I var
is omitted, the environment variable is unset. \fBspawn-filter\fR uses
\fIfromd\fR.\fIenvrules\fR to distinguish from \fIfrom\fR.\fIenvrules\fR used
by \fBqmail-smtpd(8)\fR

The name of the control file can be overriden by the environment
variable FROMRULES. Any environment variable used by
.BR spawn-filter ,
.B qmail-remote
or
.B qmail-local
can be set sender specific by using fromd.envrules.

.TP 5
.I rcpt.envrules
Specific environment variables can be set for specific recipients.
The format of this file is of the form                                       
pat:envar1=val,envar2=val,...]
where pat is a regular expression which matches a sender. envar1, envar2
are list of environment variables to be set. If
.I val
is omitted, the environment variable is unset.

The name of the control file can be overriden by the environment
variable RCPTRULES. Any environment variable used by
.BR spawn-filter ,
.B qmail-remote
or
.B qmail-local
can be set recpient specific by using rcpt.envrules.

The following list of environment variables can be modified using envrules

.IR QREGEX ,
.IR SPAMFILTER ,
.IR LOGFILTER ,
.IR SPAMFILTERARGS ,
.IR FILTERARGS ,
.IR SPAMEXITCODE ,
.IR HAMEXITCODE ,

.IR USE_FSYNC ,
and
.IR LOCALDOMAINS

.SH SPAM Filtering
If SPAMFILTER is defined,
.B spawn-filter
additionally runs a command (with command line arguments) defined by SPAMFILTER environment variable. This
gives
.B spawn-filter
the ability to filter mail messages based on the spam classification of the mail.

The environment variable SPAMFILTER apply to both local and remote mails. For individual domain level control,
it is best to set using the control file
.BR spamfilter .

.B spawn-filter
will attempt to make the descriptor 0 seekable if the environment variable MAKE_SEEKABLE
is defined. This may be necessary for certain filter programs like bogofilter to
prevent allocating memory for the mail message.

The spam filter program is expected to return 0, 1 or 2 in case the filter ran
successfully without any temporary errors. For any other exit code, 
.B spawn-filter
will assume that the filter program had some errors and will accordingly
defer mail delivery.

In this case following interpretations on the exit status will be made

 Exit Status     Interpretation
 -----------     --------------
 0,1,2           Program ran successfully. Interpretation depends
                 on filter implementation. Mail will be accepted
                 unless REJECTSPAM is set. See description below.
 anything else   Mail will be rejected with a temporary error

A typical application of this would be to run spam filtering software like
spamassasin, bogofilter, etc

When the exit code of the filter program matches SPAMEXITCODE, the mail
is considered to be spam.

If REJECTSPAM is 0, mail is accepted. If REJECTSPAM is set to 1, the mail will be bounced back
to the sender. If REJECTSPAM is greater than 1, the mail is blackholed. If
SPAMREDIRECT is set, mails will be redirected to the recipient specified
by the SPAMREDIRECT environment variable.  If both REJECTSPAM and SPAMREDIRECT is set, spam mails will
be bounced back to the sender with a copy redirected to the recipient specified in the
SPAMREDIRECT environment variable

If individual domain level control is desired on REJECTSPAM and SPAMREDIRECT environment variable,
the control files
.B rejectspam
and
.B spamredirect
can be setup without defining the REJECTSPAM and SPAMREDIRECT environment variable.

The other control files that control spam filtering are
.TP 5
.I rejectspam
The value of environment variable REJECTSPAM overrides this control file.
The format of this file is
.B domain:value
without any extra spaces. The format also can be specified as
.B domain:remote:value
and
.B domain:local:value

where domain is a valid (recipient) domain for which mails are being processed and
value should be 0 if SPAM mails should be delivered 1 for rejecting and greater
than 1 for blackholing.

.TP 5
.I spamredirect
The value of environment variable SPAMREDIRECT overrides this control file.
The format of this file is
.B domain:value
without any extra spaces. The format also can be specified as
.B domain:remote:recipient
and
.B domain:local:recipient

where domain is a valid (recipient) domain for which mails are being processed and
address should be valid recipient where the spam mails should be redirected.

.TP 5
.I spamfilter
The format of this file is of the form
.B domain:args
for both local and remote mails.
.B domain:remote:args
for remote mails and
.B domain:local:args
for local mails

where domain is a valid (recipient) domain for which mails are being processed and
args is a list of aguments to be supplied to the filter program

.EX
indimail.org:bogofilter -c QMAILHOME/etc/bogofilter.cf -p -3 -d QMAILHOME/etc/indimail.org
.EE

NOTE: For the control files spamfilter, filterargs, rejectspam, spamredirect
domain can also be a regular expression or wildcard pattern. If QREGEX envronment variable
is defined, regex is used, else wildmat)

.TP 5
.I spamignore
envelope sender addresses which should bypass spam filter.
.B spawn-filter
will bypass the filter defined by SPAMFILTER and directly exec
qmail-local/qmail-remote, if the envelope sender address is listed in
.IR spamignore .
A line in
.I spamignore
may be of the form
.BR @\fIhost ,
meaning every address at
.IR host .
.I spamignore
can be overriden by the environment variable
.BR SPAMIGNORE .
You can also create
.I spamignore.cdb
using
.BR qmail-cdb ,
in which case
.B spawn-filter
will use cdb function for fast lookup. You should create the cdb file in case you have large number of entries.

.TP 5
.I spamignorepatterns
REGEX patterns of envelope sender addresses which should bypass spam filter.
.I spamignorepatterns
can be overriden by the environment variable
.B SPAMIGNOREPATTERNS
\fIspamignorepatterns\fR gets disabled of you set \fBQREGEX\fR environment variable.
\fIspamignorepatterns\fR uses simple shell-style pattern matching unlike regular
expressions used by setting \fBQREGEX\fR environment variable.

.SH Delivery Rate Control
\fBspawn-filter\fR turns on delivery rate control if the environment variable
\fBRATELIMIT_DIR\fR is set and a rate control definition file exists in the
directory \fIRATELIMIT_DIR\fR with the same name as the recipient domain. For
details check \fBdrate\fR(1). This directory should be writeable for the user
\fIqmailr\fR.

The following control files described below apply to delivery rate control. Remember that a local rate
definition file for a domain takes precedence over any matching line in
\fIratecontrol\fR file. Any matching definition for a domain in \fIratecontrol\fR file
takes precedence over definition in .\fIglobal\fR file.

.TP 5
.I RATELIMIT_DIR/ratecontrol
You can set rate control expression for recipient domains. The format of this file is of the form
pat:mathematical_expression
where pat is a regular expression which matches the domain part the recipient. When a match occurs,
spawn-filter will automatically create a local rate definition file and the rate control will apply
to the individual domain that got matched.

.TP 5
.I RATELIMIT_DIR/.global
For recpient domains that do not have a local rate control definition and do not
match any line in RATELIMIT_DIR/ratecontrol, this file serves as the rate control
definition for all such domains. This definition does not apply individually to the
recipient domains but to sum total of all such remaining domains that do not have a
local definition.


.SH Environment Variables
\fBspawn-filter\fR sets few environment variables. The following environment variables
are set for both local and remote deliveries

.TS
l l.
Environment variable | Description
------------------------------------------------------------
DOMAIN               | domain part of recipient address
_EXT                 | the address extension

_SENDER              | envelope sender address
_RECIPIENT           | envelope recipient address
SPAMREDIRECT         | set to the envelope recipient if mail is identified
                     | by spam and redirected to address other than the
                     | original recipient using control file \fIspamredirect\fR
QUEUEDIR             | set to notification queue. This gets set when mail gets
                     | redirected to another address using control file
                     | \fIspamredirect\fR. spam filtering does not happen for
                     | the notification queue
QMAILREMOTE          | set for remote deliveries
QMAILLOCAL           | set for local deliveries

.SH "EXIT CODES"
\fBspawn-filter\fR exits 111 for any error (non-zero exit status by called program) or if it
is not able to exec QMAILHOME/bin/qmail-local (for local mails) or QMAILHOME/bin/qmail-remote
(for remote mails). It exits 100 (i.e mail will be bounced) if the REJECTSPAM environment
variable is set (or the control file has rejectspam set for the domain) and the mail is found
to be SPAM. It also exits 100 if the program/script defined by \fBFILTERARGS\fR (or defined
in the control file \fBfilterargs\fR) returns 100. If the program/script defined by
\fBFILTERARGS\fR returns 2, then the mail gets blackholed. If the program/script defined
by \fBFILTERARGS\fR exits non-zero status (other than 2), temporary error is issued and the
mail stays in the queue. For all other cases where no errors occur, it exits 0.
