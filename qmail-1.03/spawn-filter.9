.SH NAME
spawn-filter \- Interceptor for qmail-local / qmail-remote
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B spawn-filter args
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B spawn-filter
is a \fBqmail-local\fR / \fBqmail-remote\fR interceptor to help qmail run custom filters on email
being sent to \fBqmail-local\fR / \fBqmail-remote\fR. It can run any filter which reads
messages on fd 0 and writes the output on fd 1.  Whatever is output on fd 1, will be the
message that will be delivered to the destination.  The filter can be turned on individually
for local and remote mails by defining, \fBQMAILLOCAL\fR and \fBQMAILREMOTE\fR
environment variables, to the path of \fBspawn-filter\fR respectively in \fBqmail-send\fR's
supervise or rc script. For spam filtering you can additionally, set the environment variable
\fBSPAMFILTER\fR.  If \fBspawn-filter\fR is invoked as \fBqmail-local\fR, it executes the original
\fBqmail-local\fR or \ffBqmail-remote\fR after running the custom filter.  \fBspawn-filter\fR unsets
\fBQMAILLOCAL\fR when it runs as \fBqmail-local\fR. Similarly, it unsets \fBQMAILREMOTE\fR when
it runs as \fBqmail-remote\fR. This is useful in scripts to figure out whether \fBspawn-filter\fR
is running as \fBqmail-local\fR or \fBqmail-remote\fR.

Filters can be run by defining the environment variable
.B FILTERARGS
or by using the control file
.B filterargs
(see below).
.B spawn-filter
uses /bin/sh to run the filter (with arguments) specified by the
.B FILTERARGS
environment variable (or the control defined in the control file
.B filterargs
).
The environment variable
.B FILTERARGS
apply to both local and remote mails. For individual domain level control, it is best to set
using the control file \fBfilterargs\fR (see below the section on control files).
The environment variable
.B FILTERARGS
takes precedence over the control file.

.B spawn-filter
sets the environment variable
.B DOMAIN
to the recipient domain. This can be conveniently used in programs/scripts which get invoked by
setting
.B FILTERARGS
environment variable or by rules in the control file
.BR filterargs .

.SH Control Files

.TP 5
.I filterargs
The format of this file is of the form
\fBdomain:args\fR for both local and remote mails. \fBdomain:remote:args\fR
for remote mails and \fBdomain:local:args\fR for local mails. This control
file can be used to setup additional filters after running
the SPAM filters (See Section on Spam Filtering).

.EX
indimail.org:remote:QMAILHOME/bin/dk-filter
.EE

The sequence in which the filter program is run is given below
.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 3
create two pipes and fork
.IP \n+[step]
dup write end of the first pipe to descriptor 1, dup write end of the second pipe to descriptor 2 in the child and exec the filter program
.IP \n+[step]
dup read end of the pipe to descriptor 0 in parent and exec qmail-local for local mails and qmail-remote for remote mails.
.IP \n+[step]
Wait for filter to exit and read read end of second pipe for any error messages.
.IP \n+[step]
Report success or failure

This gives the ability for the any filter program to read the mail message from descriptor 0 before
passing it to qmail-local/qmail-remote through the pipe.

.PP
The other control files that
.B spawn-filter
uses are

.TP 5
.I databytes
Maximum size of mail that will be accepted before passing it to
.B qmail-remote
or
.B qmail-local

If the environment variable
.B DATABYTES
is set, it overrides
.IR databytes .
The value of databytes determines the maximum size of a message that
.B spawn-filter
will accept.

.TP 5
.I envrules
Specific environment variables can be set for specific senders/recipients.
The format of this file is of the form                                       
pat:envar1=val,envar2=val,...]
where pat is a regular expression which matches a sender. envar1, envar2
are list of environment variables to be set. If
.I var
is omitted, the environment variable is unset.

The name of the control file can be overriden by the environment
variable RCPTRULES. Any environment variable used by
.B spawn-filter
or
.B qmail-rspawn
or
.B qmail-remote
or
.B qmail-lspawn
or
.B qmail-local
can be set by using envrules.

.SH SPAM Filtering
If SPAMFILTER is defined,
.B spawn-filter
additionally runs a command (with command line arguments) defined by SPAMFILTER environment variable. This
gives
.B spawn-filter
the ability to filter mail messages based on the spam classification of the mail.

The environment variable SPAMFILTER apply to both local and remote mails. For individual domain level control,
it is best to set using the control file
.BR spamfilter .

.B spawn-filter
will attempt to make the descriptor 0 seekable if the environment variable MAKE_SEEKABLE
is defined. This may be necessary for certain filter programs like bogofilter to
prevent allocating memory for the mail message.

The spam filter program is expected to return 0, 1 or 2 in case the filter ran
successfully without any temporary errors. For any other exit code, 
.B spawn-filter
will assume that the filter program had some errors and will accordingly
defer mail delivery.

In this case following interpretations on the exit status will be made

 Exit Status     Interpretation
 -----------     --------------
 0,1,2           Program ran successfully. Interpretation depends
                 on filter implementation. Mail will be accepted
                 unless REJECTSPAM is set. See description below.
 anything else   Mail will be rejected with a temporary error

A typical application of this would be to run spam filtering software like
spamassasin, bogofilter, etc

When the exit code of the filter program matches SPAMEXITCODE, the mail
is considered to be spam.

If REJECTSPAM is 0, mail is accepted. If REJECTSPAM is set to 1, the mail will be bounced back
to the sender. If REJECTSPAM is greater than 1, the mail is blackholed. If
SPAMREDIRECT is set, mails will be redirected to the recipient specified
by the SPAMREDIRECT environment variable.  If both REJECTSPAM and SPAMREDIRECT is set, spam mails will
be bounced back to the sender with a copy redirected to the recipient specified in the
SPAMREDIRECT environment variable

If individual domain level control is desired on REJECTSPAM and SPAMREDIRECT environment variable,
the control files
.B rejectspam
and
.B spamredirect
can be setup without defining the REJECTSPAM and SPAMREDIRECT environment variable.

The other control files that control spam filtering are
.TP 5
.I rejectspam
The value of environment variable REJECTSPAM overrides this control file.
The format of this file is
.B domain:value
without any extra spaces. The format also can be specified as
.B domain:remote:value
and
.B domain:local:value

where domain is a valid (recipient) domain for which mails are being processed and
value should be 0 if SPAM mails should be delivered 1 for rejecting and greater
than 1 for blackholing.

.TP 5
.I spamredirect
The value of environment variable NOTIFYSPAM overrides this control file.
The format of this file is
.B domain:value
without any extra spaces. The format also can be specified as
.B domain:remote:recipient
and
.B domain:local:recipient

where domain is a valid (recipient) domain for which mails are being processed and
address should be valid recipient where the spam mails should be redirected.

.TP 5
.I spamfilter
The format of this file is of the form
.B domain:args
for both local and remote mails.
.B domain:remote:args
for remote mails and
.B domain:local:args
for local mails

where domain is a valid (recipient) domain for which mails are being processed and
args is a list of aguments to be supplied to the filter program

.EX
indimail.org:bogofilter -c QMAILHOME/etc/bogofilter.cf -p -3 -d QMAILHOME/etc/indimail.org
.EE

NOTE: For the control files spamfilter, filterargs, rejectspam, spamredirect
domain can also be a regular expression or wildcard pattern. If QREGEX envronment variable
is defined, regex is used, else wildmat)

.TP 5
.I spamignore
envelope sender addresses which should bypass spam filter.
.B spawn-filter
will bypass the filter defined by SPAMFILTER and directly exec
qmail-local/qmail-remote, if the envelope sender address is listed in
.IR spamignore .
A line in
.I spamignore
may be of the form
.BR @\fIhost ,
meaning every address at
.IR host .
.I spamignore
can be overriden by the environment variable
.BR SPAMIGNORE .
You can also create
.I spamignore.cdb
using
.BR qmail-cdb ,
in which case
.B spawn-filter
will use cdb function for fast lookup. You should create the cdb file in case you have large number of entries.

.TP 5
.I spamignorepatterns
REGEX patterns of envelope sender addresses which should bypass spam filter.
.I spamignorepatterns
can be overriden by the environment variable
.B SPAMIGNOREPATTERNS

.SH "EXIT CODES"
.B spawn-filter
exits 111 for any error or if it is not able to exec
QMAILHOME/bin/qmail-local (for local mails) or
QMAILHOME/bin/qmail-remote (for remote mails).
It exits 100 if the REJECTSPAM environment variable is set (or the 
control file has rejectspam set for the domain) and the mail is found to
be SPAM. It also exits 100 if the program/script defined by
.B FILTERARGS
(or defined in the control file
.B filterargs
) returns 100.
