.TH qmail-newu 8
.SH NAME
qmail-newu \- prepare address assignments for qmail-lspawn
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-newu
[
.I directory
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qmail-newu
reads the assignments in
.B directory/users/assign
and writes them into
.B directory/users/cdb
in a binary format suited
for quick access by
.BR qmail-lspawn .
If
.I directory
is omitted
.B qmail-newu
uses QMAIL. Extra arguments provided after
.I directory
are silently ignored.

If there is a problem with
.BR users/assign ,
.B qmail-newu
complains and leaves
.B users/cdb
alone.

.B qmail-newu
ensures that
.B users/cdb
is updated atomically,
so
.B qmail-lspawn
never has to wait for
.B qmail-newu
to finish.
However,
.B qmail-newu
makes no attempt to protect against two simultaneous updates of
.BR users/cdb .

The binary
.B users/cdb
format is portable across machines.
