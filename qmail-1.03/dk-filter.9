.TH dk-filter 8
.SH NAME
dk-filter \- sign/verify using DK/DKIM (SSP/ADSP optionally) and deliver a mail message for delivery
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B FILTERARGS=QMAILHOME/bin/dk-filter
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dk-filter
is a qfilter which can be set as a filter for
.BR spawn-filter(8) .
The filter can be set either as
.B FILTERARGS
or in the control file
.BR filterargs .

.B dk-filter
supports DK/DKIM signing and verification and can optionally use
.B Sender Signing Practice (SSP)
or
.B Author Domain Signing Practice.
It uses the libdkim and OpenSSL libraries.  To sign a message, set the
.B DKIMSIGN
or
.B DKSIGIN
environment variables to the pathname of the private key that will be
used to sign the message. If there is a % character in the environment
variable, it is removed and replaced by the domain name in the From: header.
If, after substituting the %, that file does not exist, QMAILHOME/control/domainkeys/%/default
will be used as the key. If again, after substituting the % sign, the file does not exist,
QMAILHOME/control/domainkeys/default will be used as the key.
After all substitutions, if the key file does not exist, the message will not be signed.
If there is no % and the file does not exist, the message will be rejected with error 35.
The selector (s=) will be taken from the basename of the file.
The private key should be created by 
.BR dknewkey(8) .

You can set various DK options in getopt style, by setting the environment variable DKSIGNOPTIONS
 b <advice_length>    Length of Advice
 c <canonicalization> simple, nofws
 s <privkeyfile>
 h                    show headers included
 r                    Skip Duplicate Headers
.EX
 DKSIGNOPTIONS="-h -r -c nofws"
 sets the h= tag, skips duplicate headers and sets nofws canonicalization
.EE

You can set various DKIM options in getopt style, by setting the environment variable DKIMSIGNOPTIONS

 b <standard>         1 - allman, 2 - ietf or 3 - both
 c <canonicalization> r for relaxed [DEFAULT], s - simple,
                      t relaxed/simple, u - simple/relaxed
 l                    include body length tag
 q                    include query method tag;
 t                    include a timestamp tag
 h
 i <identity>         the identity, if not provided it will not be included
 x <expire_time>      the expire time in seconds since epoch
                      ( DEFAULT = current time + 604800)
                      if set to - then it will not be included
 z <hash>             1 for sha1, 2 for sha256, 3 for both
 s <privkeyfile>
 y <selector>

.EX
 DKIMSIGNOPTIONS="-b 1 -c r -q"
 sets allman standard, with relaxed canonicalization and include query method tag
.EE

.B dk-filter
uses the domain found in the Sender: header to set the domain tag. If not it uses the From: header. You can override this by
setting 
.B DKIMDOMAIN
environment variable.
.B DKIMDOMAIN
can be set to an email address or a domain (without the at sign).
To verify a message, set the
.B DKIMVERIFY
or
.B DKVERIFY
environment variables
.B dk-filter
always inserts the 
.B DKIM-Status
or
.B DomainKey-Status
header, so that messages can be
rejected later at delivery time, or in the mail reader. In that case you may set
.B DKIMVERIFY
or
.B DKVERIFY
to an empty string.
.B dk-filter
does not use any signing practice byd default. You can override this by setting the SIGN_PRACTICE to ssp or adsp (lowercase).
