.SH DESCRIPTION
.B maildirqmtp
scans a maildir,
.IR dir ,
and sends each message to
.I host
through QMTP.
It removes
.I prefix
from the beginning of each envelope recipient address.
It ignores any message whose recipient address does not begin with
.IR prefix .

.B maildirqmtp
removes messages accepted by
.IR host .
It bounces messages permanently rejected by
.I host
back to the envelope sender,
and then removes them.
It treats temporary rejection as permanent rejection
for messages more than two weeks old.

Note that failure to connect to
.I host
is not temporary rejection.
If
.I host
is never reachable,
.B maildirqmtp
will never remove messages.

.B maildirqmtp
needs
.B tcpclient
in
.BR $PATH .
