.SH NAME
qmail-multi \- queue multiplexor and filter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-multi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBqmail-multi(8)\fR is a queue multiplexor and filter for \fBIndiMail(7)\fR. The
multiplexor can be turned on by defining the \fBQMAILQUEUE\fR environment variable

.EX
QMAILQUEUE=QMAILHOME/bin/qmail-multi
.EE

The filter can be turned on by defining the \fBFILTERARGS\fR environment variable.
\fBqmail-multi\fR can also do spam filtering by setting the \fBSPAMFILTER\fR
environment variable.

.B qmail-multi
also calls
.B qscanq
to perform virus scanning or bad attachment scan
if the value of the VIRUSCHECK environment variable lies
between 2 and 7.

The deposition and balancing of mail across multiple queues is controlled by
the following environment variables.

.TP 5
.B QUEUE_START
- This is a number which defines the first queue that should be used.

e.g. QUEUE_START=1 implies the first queue to be QMAILHOME/queue1

.TP 5
.B QUEUE_COUNT
- This defines the number of queues that should be used for load balancing.

e.g. QUEUE_COUNT=5 implies 5 queues QMAILHOME/queue1, QMAILHOME/queue2, ..., QMAILHOME/queue5

.TP 5
.B MIN_FREE
- This is the minimum free disk space that should be available in the filesystem containing the queues. When
free space goes below this value, qmail-multi will return a temporary disk full error
"qq write error or disk full (#4.3.0)". This prevents 
.B qmail-send
reaching a deadlock in the case when disk becomes full and there are bounce messages to be processed.
.B qmail-send
in this case keeps on retrying bounce message which does not succeeed as disk space is not there to
prepare the bounce. This effectively stops processing of local and remote messages and thus disk space never
gets freed up.
.B qmail-multi
prevents this from happening by accepting mails only when disk space greater than MIN_FREE is present. It uses
\fBstatfs(2)\fR (\fBstatvfs\fR on solaris) to get the free space on the filesystem.

.PP
If SPAMFILTER is defined,
.B qmail-multi
additionally runs a command defined by SPAMFILTER environment variable. This
gives qmail-multi the ability to filter mail messages. The program defined
by SPAMFILTER environment variable should read descriptor 0 and write to 
descriptor 1

The sequence in which the filter program is run is given below

.TP 5
1. create a pipe and fork
.TP 5
2. dup write end of the pipe to descriptor 1 in the child and exec the filter program
.TP 5
3. dup read end of the pipe to descriptor 0 in parent and exec qmail-queue
.TP 0

This gives the ability for the SPAMFILTER program to read the mail message from
descriptor 0 before passing it to qmail-queue through the pipe.

Additional arguments if required to be passed to the spam filter program can be done
by defining the environment variable SPAMFILTERARGS.
.B qmail-multi
will attempt to make the descriptor 0 seekable if the environment variable MAKE_SEEKABLE
is defined. This may be necessary for certain filter programs like bogofilter to
prevent allocating memory for the mail message.

In this case following interpretations on the exit status will be made

 Exit Status     Interpretation
 -----------     --------------
 0,1,2           Program ran successfully. Interpretation depends
                 on filter implementation. Mail will be accepted
                 unless REJECTSPAM is set. See description below.
 anything else   Mail will be rejected with a temporary error

A typical application of this would be to run spam filtering software like
spamassasin, bogofilter, etc

When the exit code of the filter program matches SPAMEXITCODE, the mail
is considered to be spam.

If REJECTSPAM is set to 1, the mail will be bounced back to the sender. If
NOTIFYSPAM is set, mails will be redirected to the recipient specified
by the NOTIFYSPAM environment variable. If NOTIFYSPAM is not set, the recipient
can be specified by the
.B globalspamredirect
control file. The email id in \fBglobalspamdirect\fR can be overriden by the environment
variable \fBGLOBALSPAMREDIRECT\fR. If both REJECTSPAM and NOTIFYSPAM is set, spam mails will
be bounced back to the sender with a copy redirected to the recipient
specified in by the NOTIFYSPAM environment variable or the
.B globalspamredirect
control file as well. you may decide not to generate
a bounce to the sender by setting the environment variable 
.B REJECTSPAM
to a value greater than 1 (i.e. black hole SPAM mails). In addition to running
SPAM filters, 
.B qmail-multi
has the ability to run any filter by setting the FILTERARGS environment
variable. Any command defined by FILTERARGS will be run using /bin/sh. The
input to this filter will be fd 0 and the output will be piped to
.B qmail-queue.
e.g.

.EX
FILTERARGS="/usr/bin/altermime --input=- --disclaimer=/etc/motd"
.EE

will append the output of altermime command to all mails.

.SH
Multiplexing LOGIC
.B qmail-multi
uses time slicing. It gets the current time since epoch and divides it by QUEUE_COUNT. This remainder is
added to QUEUE_START to arrive at which queue to use. It then sets the QUEUEDIR environment variable and
calls
.B qmail-queue.

.B
qmail-multi
is actually a wrapper for qmail-queue to manage multiple queues. N queues can be set up in
/var/qmail as queue1, queue2, ... queueN. To use  qmail-multi set the environment variable
QMAILQUEUE=/var/qmail/bin/qmail-multi. Additionally set the two environment variables QUEUE_START and
QUEUE_COUNT as the number of the first queue (excluding queue prefix) and the total number of queues
respectively.
.B qmail-multi
does load balancing across these N queues by doing exec of 
.B qmail-queue
with QUEUEDIR set as the path of one of these N queues. Each of these \fBN\fR queues should be
created using \fBqueue-fix(1)\fR program. \fBqmail-send\fR should be used with the
\fBQUEUEDIR\fR set appropriately to process these N queues.

.SH "EXIT CODES"
.B qmail-multi
does not print diagnostics.
It exits 120 if it is not able to exec
.B qmail-queue
It exits 55 if it is not able get the free space for the queue filesystem. It exits 53 if the free space
is below MIN_FREE value.
