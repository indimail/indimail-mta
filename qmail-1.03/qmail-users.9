.TH qmail-users 5
.SH NAME
qmail-users \- assign mail addresses to users
.SH OVERVIEW
The file
.B QMAIL/users/assign
assigns addresses to users. For example,

.EX
   =joe.shmoe:joe:503:78:/home/joe:::
.EE

says that mail for
.B joe.shmoe
should be delivered to user
.BR joe ,
with uid 503 and gid 78,
as specified by
.BR /home/joe/.qmail .

Assignments fed to
.B qmail-newu
will be used by
.B qmail-lspawn
to control
.BR qmail-local 's
deliveries.
See
.BR qmail-newu (8).
A change to
.B QMAIL/users/assign
will have no effect until
.B qmail-newu
is run.
.SH STRUCTURE
.B QMAIL/users/assign
is a series of assignments, one per line.
It ends with a line containing a single dot.
Lines must not contain NUL.
.SH "SIMPLE ASSIGNMENTS"
A simple assignment is a line of the form

.EX
   =local:user:uid:gid:homedir:dash:ext:
.EE

Here
.I local
is an address;
.IR user ,
.IR uid ,
and
.I gid
are the account name, uid, and gid
of the user in charge of
.IR local ;
and messages to
.I local
will be controlled by
.IR homedir\fB/.qmail\fIdashext .

If there are several assignments for the same
.I local
address,
.B qmail-lspawn
will use the first one.

.I local
is interpreted without regard to case.
.SH "WILDCARD ASSIGNMENTS"
A wildcard assignment is a line of the form

.EX
   +loc:user:uid:gid:homedir:dash:pre:
.EE

This assignment applies to any address beginning with
.IR loc ,
including
.I loc
itself.
It means the same as

.EX
   =locext:user:uid:gid:homedir:dash:preext:
.EE

for every string
.IR ext .

A more specific wildcard assignment overrides a less specific
assignment, and a simple assignment overrides any wildcard assignment.
For example:

.EX
   +:alias:7790:2108:QMAIL/alias:-::
   +joe-:joe:507:100:/home/joe:-::
   =joe:joe:507:100:/home/joe:::
.EE

The address
.B joe
is handled by the third line;
the address
.B joe-direct
is handled by the second line;
the address
.B bill
is handled by the first line.
