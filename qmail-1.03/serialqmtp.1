.TH serialqmtp 1
.SH NAME
serialqmtp \- blast files across QMTP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B serialqmtp
.I prefix
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B serialqmtp
sends messages to a QMTP server.
It expects to be run under an UCSPI client;
it sends data to the server on descriptor 7,
and reads data from the server on descriptor 6.

.B serialqmtp
reads the messages from separate files.
It reads the filenames from stdin.
Each filename is terminated by a 0 byte.

.B serialqmtp
retrieves a message's envelope sender address and envelope recipient address
from the
.B Return-Path
and
.B Delivered-To
lines at the top of the message header.
It removes these lines before passing the message along.

.B serialqmtp
removes
.I prefix
from the beginning of each envelope recipient address.
It ignores any message whose recipient address does not begin with
.IR prefix .

.B serialqmtp
reports its results on stdout.
Each result is a 0-terminated filename,
followed by a status byte,
followed by an LF-terminated readable status message.
The status byte is K if the QMTP server
has accepted responsibility for the message,
Z if the QMTP server
has temporarily rejected the message,
and
D if the QMTP server
has permanently rejected the message.
.B serialqmtp
silently truncates excessively long status messages.
.B serialqmtp
does not necessarily print a result for every file:
it may skip files,
it may have trouble reading a file from disk,
or it may have trouble talking to the QMTP server.

.B serialqmtp
uses a 73-second timeout on each network write.
