.SH NAME
qmail-remote \- send mail via SMTP / ESMTP or QMTP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-remote
.I host
.I sender
.I qqeh
.I size
.I recip
[ \fIrecip\fR ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBqmail-remote\fR reads a mail message from its input and sends the message to one or more
recipients at a remote host. The remote host \fIhost\fR is \fBqmail-remote\fR's first argument.
\fBqmail-remote\fR sends the message to \fIhost\fR, or to a mail exchanger for \fIhost\fR
listed in the Domain Name System, via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP/ESMTP) or the
Quick Mail Transfer Protocol (QMTP).  QMTP is implemented by \fBqmail-qmtpd\fR. \fIhost\fR can
be either a fully-qualified domain name:

.EX
     silverton.berkeley.edu
.EE

or an IP address enclosed in brackets:

.EX
     [128.32.183.163]
.EE
 
The size parameter is only used if the remote host uses the ESMTP SIZE extension defined in
\fIRFC- 1870\fR. It gives the size of the message in bytes. \fBqmail-remote\fR does not use
this value to process the mail, the value is only passed to the remote mailserver.

The envelope recipient addresses are listed as \fIrecip\fR arguments to \fBqmail-remote\fR.

The envelope sender address is listed as \fIsender\fR.

Any Qmail Queue Extra Header (QQEH) information passed to \fBqmail-queue(8)\fR is passed in
\fIqqeh\fR.

If \fBqmail-remote\fR is not able to get the greeting from the remote SMTP server, it tries the
next MX (as per \fBrfc-2821(5)\fR) under the following conditions

1. connection to remote host gets dropped without a greeting from the remote host

2. greeting code >= 400 and < 600

3. connection to the remote host times out.

In these cases, the remote host's IP address is recorded in the timeout table QMAIL/queue/lock/tcpto, which causes
subsequent deliveries to back off from the IP address and try the next MX (if it exists).
\fBqmail-tcpto(8)\fR can be used to print the TCP timeout table.

\fBqmail-remote\fR is MXPS compliant. If it sees the MX record

     12801 mailin-01.mx.aol.com

it will try a QMTP connection to mailin-01.mx.aol.com before trying a SMTP connection to
mailin-01.mx.aol.com. The point is that QMTP is faster than SMTP. If the QMTP connection
attempt fails, the client tries a SMTP connection to port 25 as usual. \fBqmail-remote\fR
does not try SMTP if the QMTP connection attempt succeeds but mail delivery through that
connection fails.

Note that \fBqmail-remote\fR does not take options and does not follow the \fBgetopt\fR
standard.

.SH TRANSPARENCY
End-of-file in SMTP is encoded as dot CR LF.
A dot at the beginning of a line is encoded as dot dot.
It is impossible in SMTP to send a message that does not end with a newline.
.B qmail-remote
converts the UNIX newline convention into the SMTP newline convention
by inserting CR before each LF.

It is a violation of the SMTP protocol
to send a message that contains long lines or non-ASCII characters.
However,
.B qmail-remote
will happily send such messages.
It is the user's responsibility to avoid generating illegal messages.

.B qmail-remote
may use SMTP Authenticaton to connect to remote hosts.
The following reports are provided:
.TP 5
K
no supported AUTH method found, continuing without authentication.
.TP 5
Z
Connected to 
.I host
but authentication was rejected (AUTH PLAIN).
.TP 5
Z
Connected to 
.I host 
but unable to base64encode (plain).
.TP 5
Z

.SH "RESULTS"
.B qmail-remote
prints some number of 
.I recipient reports\fP,
followed by a
.I message report\fR.
Each report is terminated by a 0 byte.
Each report begins with a single letter:
.TP 5
r
Recipient report: acceptance.
.TP 5
h
Recipient report: permanent rejection.
.TP 5
s
Recipient report: temporary rejection.
.TP 5
K
Message report: success.
.I host
has taken responsibility for delivering the message to each
acceptable recipient.
.TP 5
Z
Message report: temporary failure.
.TP 5
D
Message report: permanent failure.
.PP
After this letter comes a human-readable description of
what happened.

The recipient reports will always be printed in the same order as
.BR qmail-remote 's
.I recip
arguments.
Note that in failure cases there may be fewer
recipient reports
than
.I recip
arguments.

If \fBONSUCCESS_REMOTE\fR environment variable is defined and points to a program,
\fBqmail-remote\fR will execute the same, with uid \fIqmailr\fR, on successful email delivery
to remote host \fIhost\fR. The exit status of \fBqmail-remote\fR will be the exit status of the
program. The argument passed to this program will be the same as those for \fBqmail-remote\fR.

If \fBONFAILURE_REMOTE\fR environment variable is defined and points to a program,
\fBqmail-remote\fR will execute the same, with uid \fIqmailr\fR, on a failed email delivery
to remote host \fIhost\fR. The exit status of \fBqmail-remote\fR will be the exit status of the
program. The argument passed to this program will be the same as those for \fBqmail-remote\fR.

If \fBONTRANSIENT_REMOTE\fR environment variable is defined and points to a program,
\fBqmail-remote\fR will execute the same, with uid \fIqmailr\fR, on a deferred email delivery
to remote host \fIhost\fR. The exit status of \fBqmail-remote\fR will be the exit status of the
program. The argument passed to this program will be the same as those for \fBqmail-remote\fR.

If neither of these variables \fBONSUCCESS_REMOTE\fR, \fBONFAILURE_REMOTE\fR and \fBONTRANSIENT_REMOTE\fR
are defined, \fBqmail-remote\fR will always return zero exit status.

When these two variables are set, \fBqmail-remote\fR will also set the environment variables
.TP
.B SMTPTEXT
This will contain last SMTP conversion with the remote host.
.TP
.B SMTPCODE
This will contain last SMTP code returned by the remote host.
.TP
.B ERRTEXT
This will contain the latest local error that happened while conversing with the remote
SMTP client

.PP
\fBqmail-remote\fR uses many environment variables. These environment variables can be recipient
specific by using envrules. See \fBspawn-filter(8)\fR for more details.

.SH "CONTROL FILES"
.B qmail-remote
by default looks at QMAIL/control for all control files. This path can be changed by defining the
CONTROLDIR environment variable.

.TP 5
.I outgoingip
IP address to be used on outgoing connections.
Default: system-defined.
The value
.IR 0.0.0.0
is equivalent to the system default. The name for this control file can also be configured
by setting the environment variable \fBOUTGOINGIP\fR

.TP 5
.I outgoingip.host
Local IP bindings based on envelope recipient domain.
.I host
is the domain or host to which the mail is being delivered.
.I outgoingip.host
takes precedence over
.IR outgoingip .

.TP 5
.I domainbindings
Local IP bindings based on envelope sender domain or envelope sender address.
Each binding has the form
.IR domain\fB:\fIlocal-ip ,
or
.IR sender_addr\fB:\fIlocal-ip ,
without any extra spaces.
If
.I domain
matches
.IR host ,
or
.I sender_addr
matches
.IR sender ,
.B qmail-remote
will bind the local side of the socket for the outgoing connection to
.IR local-ip .
.I local-ip
may be empty;
this tells
.B qmail-remote
to let the OS choose the local address for outgoing connections as usual.
.I domainbindings
may include wildcards:

.EX
 user1@example.com:6.5.4.3
 example.com:5.6.7.8
 .example.com:5.6.7.9
 heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.4
 :1.2.3.5
.EE

Here the connection for any message with an envelope sender address ending with
.B .example.com
(but not
.B example.com
itself)
is bound to local address
.BR 5.6.7.9 ,
while envelope senders in
.B example.com
(but not
.B user1@example.com
itself)
are bound to 
.BR 5.6.7.8 ,
and senders in
.B heaven.af.mil
are bound to 
.BR 1.2.3.4 .
Connection for message with an envelope sender address of \fBuser1@example.com\fR gets
bound to
.BR 6.5.4.3 .
All other outgoing connections (including messages with the null return-path)
use the OS-chosen default local address. If you have the following line,

.EX
 :1.2.3.5
.EE

then all connections with address not matching any line in \fIdomainbindings\fR, will get
bound to
.BR 1.2.3.5 .
The
.B qmail
system does not protect you if you specify an invalid local address to
bind to. \fIdomainbindings\fR takes precedence over \fIoutgoingip\fR. The name for
domainbindings control file can be configured by setting \fBDOMAINBINDINGS\fR environment
variable.

.TP 5
.I bindroutes
Artificial interface binding routes.
Each route has the form
.IR remote-address\fB:\fIlocal-address ,
without any extra spaces.
If the address of the host to which we are delivering matches the remote
address, then bind the socket to the interface matching the local
address, making it appear as if the connection had originated from the
named local address instead of the default local address.
.I bindroutes
may contain suffix wildcards.
.I bindroutes
takes precedence over
.IR domainbindings .

.TP 5
.I helohost
Current host name,
for use solely in saying hello to the remote SMTP server.
Default:
.IR me ,
if that is supplied;
otherwise
.B qmail-remote
refuses to run.  If the envelope sender address matches a domain in the
.IR domainbindings
control file, the envelope sender domain will be used instead of this value.

.TP 5
.I smtproutes
Artificial SMTP routes.
Each route has the form
.IR domain\fB:\fIrelay ,
without any extra spaces.
If
.I domain
matches
.IR host ,
.B qmail-remote
will connect to
.IR relay ,
as if
.I host
had
.I relay
as its only MX.
(It will also avoid doing any CNAME lookups on
.IR recip .)
.I relay
may include a colon and a port number to use instead of the
normal SMTP port, 25:

.EX
   inside.af.mil:firewall.af.mil:26
.EE

.I relay
may be empty;
this tells
.B qmail-remote
to look up MX records as usual.
.I port
value of 465 (deprecated smtps port) causes TLS session to be started.
.I smtproutes
may include wildcards:

.EX
   .af.mil:
   :heaven.af.mil
.EE

Here
any address ending with
.B .af.mil
(but not
.B af.mil
itself)
is routed by its MX records;
any other address is artificially routed to
.BR heaven.af.mil .

The
.B qmail
system does not protect you if you create an artificial
mail loop between machines.
However,
you are always safe using
.I smtproutes
if you do not accept mail from the network.
Additionally,
.I smtproutes 
allows to forward bounces (with a 'Nullsender' MAIL FROM: <>)
literally expressed as '!@'
to a particular bounce host:

.EX
   !@:bouncehost.af.mil:27
.EE


The smtproutes control file is bypassed if the SMTPROUTE environment variable is set by
.B qmail-rspawn.
The SMTPROUTE environment variable has the same format as the entries in smtproutes control files. It is used
in a clustered environment where a single domain can exist across multiple hosts. In such a case the SMTPROUTE
variable points to the host where the user's mailbox lies.

route may also have the form

.EX
\fIdomain\fB:\fIrelay\fB:\fIport\fB:\fIpenalty\fB:\fImax_tolerance<sp>username<sp>\fIpassword\fR
.EE

without any extra spaces. If the environment variable
.B AUTH_SMTP
is set,
.B qmail-remote
will use 
.B username
and
.B password
to relay out mails through server 
.B relay
using authenticated SMTP. <sp> is a single space character. AUTH_SMTP can have the values CRAM-MD5, LOGIN or PLAIN to use
the desired authentication method. If all connections to the 
.I relay
server fail for a 
.I max_tolerance
seconds further connections to the same server, are avoided for a period of at least
.I penalty
seconds.
The default maximum period of failures that will be tolerated
.I max_tolerance 
is 120 seconds and the minimum penalty
.I penalty 
is 1 hour.
By setting the 
.I penalty 
to 0, connections to the server will be attempted inspite of failures. The default values of 1
hour for minimum penalty can be changed by setting the environment variable
.IR MIN_PENALTY .
The default value of 120 seconds for max_tolerance can be changed by setting the environment
variable
.IR MAX_TOLERANCE .

.TP 5
.I moresmtproutes.cdb
This file gives smtproutes functionality on a per-user basis. You need to create \fBmoresmtproutes.cdb\fR file
in the following format

.EX
<email_address><sp><ip_address>
.EE

Then run the command

.EX
\fBcdbmake-12\fR \fImoresmtproutes\fR.\fIcdb\fR < \fImoresmtproutes\fR.\fItmp\fR < \fImoresmtproutes\fR.\fIcdb\fR
.EE

A route obtained from moresmtproutes.cdb overrides control file \fBsmtproutes\fR or environment variable
\fBSMTPROUTES\fR. One can also redirect all bounces to a host by specifying

!@<sp><ip_address>

.TP 5
.I qmtproutes
Additional QMTP routes which have precedence over
.IR smtproutes .
QMTP routes should obey the form
.IR domain\fB:\fIrelay\fB:\fIport ,
without any extra spaces.
.I qmtproutes
follows the same syntax as
.IR smtproutes .
By default, 
.B qmail-remote
connects to QMTP service port 209. However
you can chose a dedicated high-port for QMTP communication
as defined in
.IR qmtproutes .
If the recipient domain is listed neither in \fIqmtproutes\fR nor in \fIsmtproutes\fR,
\fBqmail-remote\fR will choose the protocol according to MX priority.
The qmtproutes control file is bypassed if the QMTPROUTE environment variable is set by
.B qmail-rspawn.
The QMTPROUTE environment variable has the same format as the entries in qmtproutes control files. It is used
in a clustered environment where a single domain can exist across multiple hosts. In such a case the QMTPROUTE
variable points to the host where the user's mailbox lies.

.TP 5
.I timeoutconnect
Number of seconds
.B qmail-remote
will wait for the remote SMTP server to accept a connection.
Default: 60.
The kernel normally imposes a 75-second upper limit.

.TP 5
.I timeoutremote
Number of seconds
.B qmail-remote
will wait for each response from the remote SMTP server.
Default: 1200.

.TP 5
.I signkey
Key for Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV) signing. The filename can be overriden by the environment variable
.IR SIGNKEY .

.TP 5
.I nosignhosts
Exclusions of remote hosts for Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV)
that do not work with signed addresses.

Attention: If a host has more that one hostname, please list them
all in
.IR nosignhosts .

.TP 5
.I nosignmydoms
Exclusions of domains you host for Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV).

.TP 5
.I clientcert.pem
SSL certificate that is used to authenticate with the remote server
during a TLS session.

.TP 5
.I tlsclientciphers
A set of OpenSSL client cipher strings. Multiple ciphers
contained in a string should be separated by a colon.

.TP 5
.I tlshosts/<FQDN>.pem
.B qmail-remote
requires TLS authentication from servers for which this file exists
.RB ( <FQDN>
is the fully-qualified domain name of the server). One of the
.I dNSName
or the
.I CommonName
attributes have to match. The file contains the trusted CA certificates.

.TP 5
.I notlshosts/<FQDN>
.B qmail-remote
will not try TLS on servers for which this file exists
.RB ( <FQDN>
is the fully-qualified domain name of the server). 
.IR (tlshosts/<FQDN>.pem 
takes precedence over this file however).

.TP 5
.I tlshosts/exhaustivelist
if this file exists
no TLS will be tried on hosts other than those for which a file
.B tlshosts/<FQDN>.pem
exists.

.B WARNING:
this option may cause mail to be delayed, bounced, doublebounced, or lost.
