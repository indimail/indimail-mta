.SH DESCRIPTION

.B qmail-rm
will remove messages containing a particular string from your qmail queue.

.B
qmail-rm
is useful for removing mails from queue if hit by sudden SPAM.  For 
instance, if you are hit with a spamming attack, you can temporarily
instate a second qmail installation (once the spam run is finished),
allow it to take over mail receipt, and then use this tool to clean
the offending mails out of the queue before switching over to the main
qmail installation once again.

Occasionally, viruses will get past scanners before the signatures
get updated; if they exist in large numbers, it is often practical to
stop the qmail install briefly in order to clean out all messages 
containing a signature related to the virus.

Whatever the reason to pull items from your mail queue, this program
will delete them in such a manner that will let you restore them easily.

Mails are *not* deleted from the queue!  They are only stored, temporarily,
in queuedir/yanked/, where you can view them individually and
restore them back to the queue manually.  There is currently no support
for restoring them automatically.

By default, 
.B qmail-rm
assumes that your qmail queue is stored in
QMAILHOME/queue, but this can be changed with a command line option.
Similarly,
.B qmail-rm
assumes that your queue "split" is 151 by
default, among other things.

See qmail-rm -h for more commandline options.

WARNING: YOU MUST STOP QMAIL BEFORE USING THIS PROGRAM.
