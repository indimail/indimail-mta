/var/indimail/bin/clamdscan --quiet ./
The first line of this file gives the scan command to be executed by qscanq.
The command may be any command line invoking a virus scanner that scans
the current directory (and any subdirectories), and returns:
0 - if no virus is detected,
1 - if a virus is detected, and
something else if a runtime error occurs.

Examples:
/var/qmail/bin/run-antivir		# Wrapper for antivir
/var/indimail/bin/clamscan -r --quiet --tempdir=. .	# clamscan w/o wrapper
/var/indimail/bin/clamdscan --quiet ./			# clamdscan

(NOTE: The "#" and subsequent text are NOT meant to be copied into the
first line of the file; they are comments for your benefit.)
