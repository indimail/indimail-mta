indimail-mta is fhs complieant. You need to edit the following files
conf-shared     - this is where boot, plugins go
conf-prefix     - this is where bin, sbin go
conf-sysconfdir - this is where etc, control, users go

You can have the old non-fhs behaviour by having /var/indimail in the above 3 files
