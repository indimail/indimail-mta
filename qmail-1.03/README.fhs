indimail-mta is fhs compliant. You need to edit the following files

conf-shared       - this is where boot, doc go
conf-prefix       - this is where bin, sbin go
conf-sysconfdir   - this is where etc, control, users go
conf-qmail        - domains, alias, queue, autoturn, qscanq, symlinks control, users, bin and sbin
/usr/lib/indimail - plugins, modules (architecture-dependent files)

You can have the old non-fhs behaviour by having /var/indimail in the above 3 files
