qmail-tcpto \- print TCP timeout table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-tcpto
.SH DESCRIPTION
After an SMTP connection attempt times out,
.B qmail-remote
records the relevant IP address.
If the same address fails again (after at least two minutes with
no intervening successful connections - \fImax_tolerance\fR),
.B qmail-remote
assumes that further attempts will fail for at least another hour (\fImin_backoff\fR).

\fIsmtproutes\fR can be used to control \fImax_tolerance\fR and \fImin_backoff periods\fR.

.B qmail-tcpto
prints
.BR qmail-remote 's
current list of timeouts.

.B qmail-tcpto
must be run either as 
.B root
or with user id
.B qmailr
and group id
.BR qmail .
\fBqmail-tcpto\fR uses the environment variable QUEUE_BASE or the conrol file \fBqbase\fR if
present to use the queue base. If the environment variables QUEUE_START and QUEUE_COUNT are set,
\fBqmail-tcpto\fR will process multiple queues present in the queue base.
