/*
 * Machinery for handling UID lists live here.  This is mainly to support
 * RFC1725/RFC1939-conformant POP3 servers without a LAST command, but may also
 * be useful for making the IMAP4 querying logic UID-oriented, if a future
 * revision of IMAP forces me to.
 *
 * These functions are also used by the rest of the code to maintain
 * string lists.
 *
 * Here's the theory:
 *
 * At start of a query, we have a (possibly empty) list of UIDs to be
 * considered seen in `oldsaved'.  These are messages that were left in
 * the mailbox and *not deleted* on previous queries (we don't need to
 * remember the UIDs of deleted messages because ... well, they're gone!)
 * This list is initially set up by initialize_saved_list() from the
 * .fetchids file.
 *
 * Early in the query, during the execution of the protocol-specific
 * getrange code, the driver expects that the host's `newsaved' member
 * will be filled with a list of UIDs and message numbers representing
 * the mailbox state.  If this list is empty, the server did
 * not respond to the request for a UID listing.
 *
 * Each time a message is fetched, we can check its UID against the
 * `oldsaved' list to see if it is old.
 *
 * Each time a message-id is seen, we mark it with MARK_SEEN.
 *
 * Each time a message is deleted, we mark its id UID_DELETED in the
 * `newsaved' member.  When we want to assert that an expunge has been
 * done on the server, we call expunge_uid() to register that all
 * deleted messages are gone by marking them UID_EXPUNGED.
 *
 * At the end of the query, the `newsaved' member becomes the
 * `oldsaved' list.  The old `oldsaved' list is freed.
 *
 * At the end of the fetchmail run, seen and non-EXPUNGED members of all
 * current `oldsaved' lists are flushed out to the .fetchids file to
 * be picked up by the next run.  If there are no un-expunged
 * messages, the file is deleted.
 *
 * One disadvantage of UIDL is that all the UIDs have to be downloaded
 * before a search for new messages can be done. Typically, new messages
 * are appended to mailboxes. Hence, downloading all UIDs just to download
 * a few new mails is a waste of bandwidth. If new messages are always at
 * the end of the mailbox, fast UIDL will decrease the time required to
 * download new mails.
 *
 * During fast UIDL, the UIDs of all messages are not downloaded! The first
 * unseen message is searched for by using a binary search on UIDs. UIDs
 * after the first unseen message are downloaded as and when needed.
 *
 * The advantages of fast UIDL are (this is noticeable only when the
 * mailbox has too many mails):
 *
 * - There is no need to download the UIDs of all mails right at the start.
 * - There is no need to save all the UIDs in memory separately in
 * `newsaved' list.
 * - There is no need to download the UIDs of seen mail (except for the
 * first binary search).
 * - The first new mail is downloaded considerably faster.
 *
 * The disadvantages are:
 *
 * - Since all UIDs are not downloaded, it is not possible to swap old and
 * new list. The current state of the mailbox is essentially a merged state
 * of old and new mails.
 * - If an intermediate mail has been temporarily refused (say, due to 4xx
 * code from the smtp server), this mail may not get downloaded.
 * - If 'flush' is used, such intermediate mails will also get deleted.
 *
 * The first two disadvantages can be overcome by doing a linear search
 * once in a while (say, every 10th poll). Also, with flush, fast UIDL
 * should be disabled.
 *
 * Note: some comparisons (those used for DNS address lists) are caseblind!
